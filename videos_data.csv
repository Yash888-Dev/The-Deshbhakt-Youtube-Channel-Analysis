After months of threats, tariffs & tantrums - Donald Trump finally met with China's Xi Jinping, in an attempt to douse the fire he lit himself. From MAGA to praising Xi as a “tremendous leader” - what happened to the aggressive trade war launched by Trump?? Did China really beat America??? 

Also - what does the scaling down of US - China tensions mean for India?? Why is India still struggling under heavy tariffs??? Why can China negotiate from a position of strength while India bends to pressure???
The answers reveal more about our economic reality than any government slogan ever will.

While the opposition is 'hoping' that it will get the anti-incumbency vote - it has not been able to create a narrative of its own - or corner the BJP on key issues (like jobs) .... from what was an OPEN ELECTION a few months ago - its become too close to call. 

Will the NDA manage to pull though again this time??? - despite 20 years of Nitish Kumar incumbency?? Would the Congress blame it on vote chori again???  Why the grand old party has already 'lost' the battle.

Should our outrage shift from crackers to focusing on solutions to the year-round toxic air that we continue to breathe.On The Deshbhakt - why pollution isn’t a 2-day problem and why real change requires more than Diwali outrage.

In the first look it might seen that India’s middle class is living it up! New homes, cars, gadgets, foreign trips and endless shopping festivals. But dig deeper & a dangerous truth emerges - most of this 'prosperity' runs on EMIs. What looks like Middle India's progress may actually be a massive debt bomb - waiting to explode. 
In this episode of The Deshbhakt, we uncover how India quietly turned from a “middle-class dream” to an “EMI-class reality.” With salaries stagnant or jobs being lost - household debt & credit card defaults are skyrocketing.
How deep does this problem go?? From families to governments - and is there a way out before the next financial crisis hits?

Will Trump’s Middle East Deal Hold?

Hostages are home, leaders are celebrating and Trump is back in the Middle East taking credit for ‘ending the war. But beneath the celebrations, one question refuses to die down - is this truly the end of the war, or just the beginning of another chapter? Already Israel’s shooting down of Palestinians have started post ceasefire. 
Meanwhile Gaza lies in ruins, thousands are dead and the world’s silence over this atrocity still echoes louder than any ceasefire announcement. What really happened in these two years of (one sided) war? How did it expose the hypocrisy of world powers, international media and the so-called global peacekeepers? Who really won this war? It surely wasn't Israel.

Has “national security” become the new excuse to befriend even those we once terrorists - not long ago?
Meanwhile Afghanistan’s clash with Pakistan - has got Trump involved - also bringing to light the gro-political game that is afoot. What’s forcing India to look at the Taliban differently? Is this diplomacy or desperation?

Yet, few leaders have navigated this chaos with the precision and foresight as Nitish Kumar has. Taking the state from Lalu's grip - 20yrs ago - Nitish has remained at the centre of Bihar’s story through political manoeuvres, U-turns & strategic alliances.
In this Deshbhakt Mini-documentary - we study  the rise of a leader who turned challenges into opportunities, earning the titles of both 'Sushasan Babu' and a master of political pragmatism. From early struggles in the JP Movement to repeated comebacks as Chief Minister, his journey is a testament to survival, strategy, and influence.

On Deshbhakt Samvaad - Rahul Bhuchar joins to talk about the original message of Ram, the intent of Ramanaya & why this narrative encompasses all other narratives in the world.

It was meant to be the scheme that changed the face of India’s economy. But more than a decade later - has it really delivered on any of its promises????

Not only that - Wangchuk’s FCRA licence stands cancelled and he’s being probed for ‘foreign connections’
Why did the Govt choose to go so hard on someone who used to be an avid Modi supporter? A popular educator is now a 'foreign agent' ... What is the BJP sacred of??? Why does this sound like bad news for Indian Democracy & right to protest (or whatever is left of it)

But this week, the streets of Leh erupted in violence, BJP offices torched, police firing, curfew imposed. What pushed a community known for calm into such chaos overnight?
Behind the headlines of violence lies a story of broken promises, ignored demands and propaganda campaigns that brand Ladakhis as traitors. From Sonam Wangchuk’s hunger strike to fears of losing land, jobs, and identity, this is not just about one protest.  
It is about the survival of an entire region.

With pressure on media giant Disney - one of America’s leading late-night hosts, Jimmy Kimmel, was thrown out of his show last week. Trump's message was clear - jokes are dangerous in America today - especially if he's the target.

If not sad - this would have been funny...from Colbert’s cancellation to Kimmel’s silencing, comedians & the free press is being silenced in America .... the pressure this indirect but powerful - reshaped under corporate deals and government intimidation.

GST 2.0 has kicked off with massive promises. The Prime Minister Modi - himself calling on people to partake in this ‘GST Bachat Utsav’ - While there are many high-points and course corrections in Next Gen GST Reforms - (like lower insurance premiums, cheaper groceries & lakhs slashed in car prices)….there is however a more worrying angle ….
 
The Govt has been forced to bring this GST Reforms (8 years late) because of a slowing consumption economy, US Tariffs looming and need to make business easier - however - even with reduced rates....does India have the money to spend in this great 'utsav' - or are we already drowning in debt???

Can America's Loss Become India's Gain? | Why Trump Went Nuclear On H1B Visas | Akash Banerjee,u9-0Nl2a32w,2025-09-20T17:23:54Z,1601392,43339,5870,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u9-0Nl2a32w/default.jpg,1290,#video,"President Trump’s H1B announcement has sent shockwaves - hitting Indians the hardest. A single executive order has sent panic across the tech industry and left lakhs of H1B visa holders staring at an uncertain future. What was once a dream path to Silicon Valley may now become unaffordable overnight.
But is Trump truly protecting American jobs, or is this a political theatre - designed to fire up Trump’s base? Even if the US shuts its doors, will India really benefit from the return of talent or is that just another fantasy? In today’s Deshbhakt episode, we break down Trump’s $100K visa bomb, its impact on India and whether America is sabotaging itself in the process.

🚨After deliberately misleading the world with false statements on VISA TIMELINES - Karoline Leavitt clarifies on H1B Mess 
(was this confusion deliberate to create panic and force people to leave?) 
1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.
(annual would have totally killed H1B)
2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. 
3.) H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation.
(thank go for small mercies) 
3.) This applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders.  It will first apply in the next upcoming lottery cycle.
(the H1B crisis is still coming - next year and Trump may not stop here)

Even as we were publishing this episode - comes the news that Nepal’s interim PM could be Sushila Karki. What began as a youth-led revolution for freedom and accountability in Nepal - spread into chaos. Within hours of PM Oli’s resignation, violence, arson and jailbreaks shook the nation, raising disturbing questions about who truly benefits from this unrest?? From political elites to infiltrators, no one is above suspicion.

But change of guard done - the bigger challenge lies ahead: with the old order gone, who will lead Nepal into a new era? Can Gen Z transform their movement into a meaningful nation-building exercise….or will the country slip deeper into instability? This a turning point that could redefine Nepal’s future.

What signals did China send through this parade? How do its new weapons alter the balance of power? And most importantly, what lessons must India draw before the dragon breathes fire on our borders?

The Untold Story | How Election Commission Of India Was Made - Then Unmade | Akash Banerjee,_jj8q6GZYCY,2025-09-06T17:49:23Z,1881329,39028,2430,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_jj8q6GZYCY/default.jpg,2226,#video,"In 1951, India attempted the impossible - conducting the largest democratic experiment in the world (with very limited means) Ever since then - India's democratic system & her Election Commission has been proving western naysayers wrong; proving that India can overcome numerous challenges & yet prove to a democratic nation which conducts largely free and fair elections. 

Its not that the EC has not had its challenges - from booth capturing in the 70s & 80s - to the iron hand of TT. N. Seshan in the 90s...from no code to the MCC .... from paper ballots to EVMs - every Election Commission has had to fight its own battled. But why is the Election Commission of India today - facing its worse crisis ever? What changed in this once glorious institution that politicians feared and respected.
Who caused this reputational damage and can the EC of India be repaired?

Eight years after India's 'second independence' - GST is undergoing a massive redo. While these changes are being pained as 'Next Gen GST Reforms' - they basically correct a lot of errors that were pointed out years ago.
While the Govt really has slashed a lot of rates - will it bring relief to the common man and by how much. Why did the Modi Govt quickly move such a massive reform - after holding its ground for 8years??? - Here's a look at GST 2.0 - beyond the headlines hype.

From 1988 to 2025, the story has remained the same. Natural factors - booted by human callousness and incompetence. Is Punjab’s tragedy just 'nature’s fury' or a disaster we’ve designed for ourselves?

Apps were banned, Chinese products were shunned and news studios were rallying an anti-China mob. Fast forward a few months - suddenly China is being projected as India’s 'partner in prosperity'
PM Modi attending the SCO Summit in China comes at a time when India-US ties are at their lowest in decades. But does that mean a shift towards China is good for India?? 
Is India making a bold strategic gamble that could pay off or Modi could end up repeating the same mistake that Nehru made6 decades ago.
Behind the photo-ops and diplomatic smiles - lies a deeper story about geopolitics, economy and survival. The story - as always, is not so simple.

What began as “Direct Action” turned into one of the most shameful chapters of our freedom struggle.
But was The Great Calcutta Killings only about Hindu-Muslim hatred or was it the result of deadly political games, soaring ambitions, provocative speeches and inaction of those in power?
Nearly 80 years later, why does this event still matter? What role did Jinnah, Suhrawardy and the Congress play? Why couldn’t Gandhi stop the bloodshed that followed? And most importantly - what lessons are we ignoring even today, as our politics and society seem to walk a dangerously familiar path? 
Decoding that and a lot more - in this Deshbhakt special episode.

Floods, landslides, and cloudbursts have become frighteningly routine, with shocking visuals repeating year after year. But the bigger question is: are these tragedies only nature’s fury, or is there something deeper, something human-made driving this destruction?

Because if these disasters are now so predictable, then why does nothing change? Are we pushing the mountains and nature to a point of no return, ignoring warning after warning? The answers reveal a crisis that’s far bigger than just rain and it’s one that India can no longer afford to overlook.

Pt.2 - What Is The EC of India Trying To Hide? | Rahul Gandhi's Vote Chori Charge | Akash Banerjee,OaIwDd53ZmA,2025-08-12T17:05:40Z,2464347,107974,9568,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OaIwDd53ZmA/default.jpg,1433,#video,"The INDIA Bloc, led by Rahul Gandhi, finally appears energised & united as an opposition. Rahul Gandhi's detailed claims on large-scale voter list fraud has stumped the EC (with more revelations coming by the hour)
The Election Commission has not been able to debunk these charges - leading us to ask 2 questions.
1. Has the EC failed totally in maintaining voter lists and preventing frauds ?
2. Are voter lists being mismanaged at the behest of the BJP to influence elections?  

In this episode of The Deshbhakt, we examine Rahul Gandhi’s strategy of cornering the EC on ‘Vote Chori’.  Why is the BJP and EC insistent on him providing evidence under oath? Could this show of opposition unity be a turning point for our democracy? And most importantly - at what scale is ‘Vote Chori’ really happening?

The Truth Of Ethanol Blended Petrol | Why Nitin Gadkari Could Be Misleading Us | Akash Banerjee,3KSdsJlUZPU,2025-08-11T16:05:08Z,2563338,65732,8951,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3KSdsJlUZPU/default.jpg,1280,#video,"Opposition on the streets over Vote Chori - next cars could be blocking roads due to Ethanol Blending making them collapse. Govt INSISTS that 20% blended ethanol is safe for cars - but experts and even car manufactures say otherwise. 

Many vehicle owners have already started reporting problems such as reduced mileage, engine knocking, and other performance issues. Despite these growing complaints, the government seems determined to convince people that E20 is beneficial, but the reality appears far from their claims.

In this episode of The Deshbhakt, we uncover the truth behind E20 fuel, how the government policy is slowly damaging your car’s engine, why 20% ethanol blending can be disastrous for most vehicles and what vested interests Union Minister Nitin Gadkari might have in pushing this policy.

His allegations immediately drew a lot of heat and criticism from both the EC and the BJP, but have his allegations been debunked as false even after 2 days?? 
How can over 1 lakh fake voters be created in ONE constituency magically??? How can 80 people live in one address?? Is the EC totally incompetent to stop this malpractice? Worse - Was the 2024 Lok Sabha elections compromised? 

In this episode of The Deshbhakt, we take a look at Rahul Gandhi’s claims, whether what he said about the Election Commission colluding with the BJP in ‘vote chori’ is true or not, and why this is a dangerous sign for our democracy. We also discuss what the opposition needs to do or should have done to curb such election fraud.

TCS - India’s most trusted IT giant has just laid off 12,000 middle & senior management employees - sending sock-waves in the tech industry. This isn’t a normal layoff, this is a warning that AI and automation are rapidly replacing humans and even top companies aren’t immune. 

Freshers are being ghosted, experienced professionals are being deemed “obsolete” and job security is vanishing. If TCS can do this, what hope is left for the rest? Is India’s IT dream collapsing before our very eyes? In this episode, we break down the real reasons behind the layoffs and how to survive the AI takeover that’s just started.

Israel Starves Gaza - As The World Watches On | Can This Open Genocide Be Stopped? | Akash Banerjee,u7tZqzZUAPk,2025-08-04T17:03:29Z,919758,55491,8138,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u7tZqzZUAPk/default.jpg,1419,#video,"After nearly 2 years of being pounded by Isreal with bombs and bullets - Gaza is just a ghost town. After the Genocide - comes the Famine -  that has not even spared children. A brutal starvation and forced famine by Isreal could take thousands more lives - adding to the already gruesome toll of 60,000 (official) 
While the Hamas is nowhere to be found & hostages still in Gaza .... does that allow for the killing of 20,000 children and starving many more? 
Finally it seems that the world has had enough of Israel's high handedness & brutality. They are speaking up against the Zionists - several European and other countries condemning Israel’s conduct - calling for sanctions and punishment for the crimes being committed.
But many wonder - why the delay? Will these words lead to action? Or is this just optics to hide international guilt? 

In this episode of The Deshbhakt, we break down the situation in Gaza, what the world is (and isn’t) doing to help Palestinians, what the global support for Palestine really signifies, and how long can this bloodshed continue?

Beyond the disputed legacy - the question few are asking - what comes next?
Why has no Indian fighter been able to replace the Mig-21 after so many years? 
Will our fighter strength be reduced to that of Pakistan? 

🚨Correction🚨
While making this episode we inadvertently referred to Flight Lieutenant Abhijit Gadgil as Lieutenant Abhijit Gadgil & his fighter jet crashed on 17 September 2001 and not 21 September as mentioned in the episode. We will try to do better and stay as accurate as humanly possible.

Earlier a VP quit - only to contest a Presidential election ... but Dhankhar had 2 more years to his term.

The reaction (as expected) has not been kind on Trump and Co.

Shockingly the report makes a clear insulation towards the role of the pilots - without going into the details of how this could well be a hardware / software failure as well. The fact that the fuel cutoff switch was a KNOWN issue has been brushed under the carpet. 
Are the 787 investigators making another 737-Max style mistake???
Who is this report trying to save???

After Iran-Israel Ceasefire - Will Gaza See Some Relief Or More Pain? | Akash Banerjee,LSFWYCwirtw,2025-06-25T17:21:05Z,1538844,70334,7672,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LSFWYCwirtw/default.jpg,1096,#video,"For some the Israel-Iran ceasefire has given hope that the international community will work towards the resolution of the Gaza crisis - where there is a clear humanitarian crisis happening … however the IDF says that now free of Iran duties - they will ‘focus’ more on Gaza. What does this mean ?? More pain and bad news?? Will Netanyahu take out his Iran frustrations on Gaza? 
Can the international community finally break its wall of silence and stop what is happening in Gaza or we will continue to act deaf, dumb & blind? 

🚨There is a growing realisation in the West that Zionists have used the shield of 'anti-Semitism' to shut anyone who questions their acts of cruelty. But Zionism is NOT Judaism, in fact its a perversion of Judaism - as explained brilliantly by Yaakov Shapiro

Why Trump Pleaded For A Israel-Iran Ceasefire | Middle East Crisis Defused? | Akash Banerjee,LUs4luvC4JQ,2025-06-24T17:20:59Z,2564416,83768,5624,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LUs4luvC4JQ/default.jpg,1125,#video,"Trump deserves a Nobel Prize (for most persistent efforts atleast) 
Just 2 days after dragging America into a war with Iran and faced massive heat from home - Trump pulled off another surprise - this time virtually forcing Israel to commit to a ceasefire (that came very reluctantly) 
Will this ceasefire hold? Who won this 12 day war? What next about Iran's Nuclear Ambitions?

A day later - the Trump administration is not so sure - what those mega bunker buster GBU-57s hit - could be that Iran got away with all the uranium??  
Worse, Trump is losing his core MAGA support base over this attack and he is being exposed as a puppet of Israel for joining the war on Netanyahu's instructions.

Soon enough America attacked Iran.

After their CMO was publicly humiliated by Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane - the doctors have shown massive unity and hit back with an ultimatum.
They have even thrown Rane's social media (half) apology in to the dustbin - asking him - instead to apologise at the very place where he humiliated their CMO - or else Goa doctors go on a strike.

If India is now among the top 5 global economies, why aren’t most Indians feeling the change in their daily lives? Why is the middle class still struggling, and why are the poor still being left behind?
What exactly did we beat Japan in?

If this new trend of gawaar-swag is not stopped soon - the day is not far when Indians will be barred from foreign destinations.

Yet we are hemming & hawing over this one question of lost jets? What is this obsession over a conflict with zero losses? 
If a clear answer was not to be given - why agree for the interview?? You thought that an international outlet like Bloomberg will NOT ask uncomfortable questions?  Everyone is not Godi.

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
Here's what YOU can do to put pressure on YouTube to update / change / modify its US made, flawed 3-strike-policy. Send a mail to support-in@google.com - tell them how this policy is being misused in India / why they need to update it for Indian law.
OR
You can also send a mail to the supremecourt@nic.in - so that they can take suo moto cognizance of the matter and pass an order that leads to a clear definition of 'fair use'

In this episode of Deshbhakt - we look ONLY at international sources (not Indian) to find out what the world thinks of Pakistan and Army/ISI links to terror and why this terror tap needs to be closed now.

What happened to the best Foreign Minister 'ever' ?? Why is India so friendless??

But on the Pakistani side - there is no show of compromise or relief - it is celebration over a military 'win' and downing of Rafael jets ... 
India however is clear - we hit their targets & a new red line has been drawn - any terrorism from Pakistan -  will be treated as an act of war.

Along with the war on Terror - India will have to effectively battle the war against mis-information. Here's why.

However the Govt has also clamped down on any uncomfortable questions about lapses that led to Pahalgam. Is it 'too soon' to ask questions from our Govt?? What has been the BJP's track record of asking questions after a Pakistani attack- when it was in the opposition?? 
Why India needs to do BOTH - ask questions to itself and give Pakistan a befitting answer.

First the bodyblow against Governors acting illegally by pocket voting bills - then came the massive hearing on the Waqf Bill that the Govt had considered as a 'done deal' 

Can the SC undo acts passed by the Parliament of India? Is the Supreme Court acting as a SUPER PARLIAMENT - as alleged by the Vice President of India?? 
Here's why India needs more of the Supreme Court  - not less.

But while China is moving to take advantage of the Trump's tariff tantrums - India is buckling up for a right ride - part of the reason is that our next gen companies (especially in critical deep tech areas) are missing.

While Piyush Goel recognised that hard fact - he's come under heavy fire for not accepting who's to blame for this mess. Goel says it's the Congress - but the startups have a different point of view.
How far are we from China / where did we go wrong / can we still save the day???

His actions have not only provoked a sharp rebuke from the Supreme Court - but also exposed the Congress Party's double speak. 

🚨But SOME stories do have a happy ending - faced with immense pressure from Students & Courts - Reddy Govt is backtracking from the action of the 400 acre land and instead wants to develop a 2000 acre Eco-Park.

The US Economy healty on most parameters just 2 months ago - is now staring at a possible recession. The US Markets melted on Monday and investor confidence is nearing Covid levels. Worse - this has been caused mostly by Trump’s own doing - his ham handed and ill planned move to launch a tariff war is causing deep stress to the US Economy and sending global markets into unchartered waters. Can India find a way out of this mess? Could this be used to our advantage?

Watch Part One - if you want to understand the roots of Delimitation 
we had warned about this a long times ago - https://youtu.be/Hqm1j1zeuMI?si=Ep8nyi02Qw2bEJt6

Tamil Nadu CM Stalin has called for all-party meet on delimitation, he says that he is ready for ‘major war’ for his state's rights. The idea that delimitation would leave Tamil Nadu with fewer parliamentary seats is not acceptable to the state and is being seen as a big by the Centre to curtail the state’s autonomy and rights.

Amit Shah has said that TN will not lose any seats - but is that just the half truth??
What about states like UP / Bihar / Rajasthan? - is Indian Democracy about to change as we know it?

Trump Forcing Modi Govt To Buy F-35 Jets? | US Fighter Right Choice For India? | Akash Banerjee,HVFBWEs_NUs,2025-02-17T17:42:10Z,1945447,39215,5009,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HVFBWEs_NUs/default.jpg,1247,#video,"Ever since Trump made the announcement - that America intends to sell F-35 Fighter Jets to India - there has been a huge debate over the merits and demerits of the jet. 

Is Trump selling us a very expensive toy - that breaks down often ??? Or will this give India a major strategic advantage ??? On Deshbhakt we weigh the pros and cons of F-35 vs Russian Su-57 .... but even more critical - how did we land up here as a nation??? On one hand reach Mars and Moon - on the other we are a OVER A DECADE away from our own 5th Gen Fighter Jet. How did China become so atmanirbhar - but we failed since the 1980s to create our own frontline combat aircraft????

But the kind of police action / NCW summons / even Parliamentary Panel note - shows that something bigger is afoot. Is this a pretext for some Govt action on Digital Media??? 

No doubt that Ranveer and Samay have a lot of answer for - but compared to the filth on social media today - this was kindergarten stuff. There is an urgent need to stop the vulgarity that is spreading on Social Media - else the Govt will have every right to clamp down of what we consume and how.

This is not just the story of Manipur - this is a story of how political is played in India today. Where only power matters - nothing else.

What do the facts say about him?? Does his OWN writing expose him??? Was he crusading rationalist?  / 'Veer' Freedom Fighter / or a grovelling agent of the British? 

Arun Shourie's new book on Savarkar has just been released and it's an important work because it mostly quotes what Savarkar wrote himself - in his own words. Hope this interview helps you understand the difference between the truth and hyperbole.

Arun Shoure took time off to have a detailed chat on Savarkar, his ideas for India and why Savarkar remained affectionate towards the British - right till the end.

The New Icon: Savarkar and the Facts - in stores and online now.

What Maddox Films manages to do is deliver a story of valour of the IAF - without using too much jingoism and sticking to the facts - this is commendable for a Bollywood movie - but will that be enough to make Sky Force cross the finishing line?

That is what Meghnad has decided to find out - arguably India's First Content Creator who's on the Ballot (as an independent candidate from Delhi's Malviya Nagar).... He's up against Somnath Bharti of AAP - who's represented the Malviya Nagar constituency since 2013.

But winning is not the only agenda it seems..... 
Listen to this - it's deeply interesting!

When someone will tell us that in 2023 - 5 journalists were killed and 226 were targeted by state agencies, non-state political actors, anti-social elements, and criminals across India - we will not bat an eyelid. But if an international ranking puts us at 160 / 180 in press freedom - all hell brakes-lose 

Mukesh Chandrakar's brutal end is a reminder to us - how genuine / small town journalism is being eradicated. Either you have to sell your soul and those who chose to work and use Digital Broadcast as a tool - are being silenced by other means. This is not an exception - this is the rule now....

How China Solved Its Air Pollution Crisis | Why India Failed | Akash Banerjee & Adwaith,N7qtQ_T0aF8,2024-12-27T15:07:19Z,1987218,46278,3967,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N7qtQ_T0aF8/default.jpg,1401,#video,"🚨Get Testbook Pass Pro Today - https://link.testbook.com/cgFAloZDFPb

🚨42 of the top 50 most polluted cities in the world are in India 
🚨India was the 3rd most polluted country in the world - behind Bangladesh and Pakistan 
🚨Delhi is NOT the most polluted metropolitan area - it comes 3rd after Begusarai (Bihar) & Guwahati (Assam)
🚨Air Pollution is NOT a Delhi / Delhi NCR / Punjab / North India only problem - its now a PAN-INDIA crisis
//
These were the findings of the 'World Air Quality Report 2023' by Swiss air quality monitoring body #IQAir ... The 2024 report would be out soon & India would be found choking again - even as China makes rapid strides in combating pollution.
Where did we go wrong??? Did playing petty politics and blame game help the citizens of India? 
Is there still a way?

Which Model Will Make For A Better India? | Deshbhakt Samvaad With Manish Sisodia & Jasmine Shah,DSGqvenQts4,2024-12-23T16:33:28Z,460919,14009,1737,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DSGqvenQts4/default.jpg,3437,#video,"With Delhi Assembly Elections just around the bend - all eyes are on a AAP vs BJP fight. The Aam Aadmi Party is confident that its 'Delhi Model' will ensure them a victory - but what is the Delhi Model of Governance ??? Is it only a basket of freebies for potential voters or a form of welfare governance that makes lives better? 

AAP Leader Jasmine Shah has just come out with a new book detailing the making and working of the Delhi Model and why this actually works much better than the hyped Gujarat Model. Shah believes that this is a model that can be used pan-India to make the country better.

We sit down with Former Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and Jasmine Shah to understand the Delhi Model - how it works (what parts did not) and if such a model can exist and thrive in todays India that is marred by personality and identity politics.

Aiyar takes questions on all the controversies he's involved in - all the political shenanigans played on him - the rise of the right and what can save India now.... We also dive into some important points covered in his new book - A Maverick in Politics

For DECADES the Assad family had an iron grip over Syria - then a sudden flash - it was all gone in less than a week. Was this really an ‘internal revolt’?? Or was Assad’s stay in power and eventual fall - scripted well outside the borders of Syria? 

With the fall of Assad's regime, the Middle East faces yet another destabilized nation, adding to the turmoil in Lebanon, Gaza, and Iran. In this episode of The Deshbhakt , we analyze the origins and trajectory of the Syrian conflict, the involvement of global powers, and the catastrophic human toll. Can peace ever prevail in the Middle East, or will the region continue to spiral into chaos?

Despite the act being specifically designed to save India from digging up the past - there are atleast SIX cases coming up for hearing in higher courts - that challenge the sanctity and very existence of old mosques in India. 

Why the sudden spurt of cases? How come the courts are passing orders so quickly? Is this all a coincidence ??? Or a well thought out plan to force the system to give a certain outcome. Is India going into an Ayodhya 2.0 phase?

CASE STUDY - Can Ritesh Agarwal Save Oyo From Becoming Another Byjus? | Akash Banerjee & Manjul,MMr3TAJ2IWI,2024-11-24T14:23:22Z,1811022,34031,1632,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MMr3TAJ2IWI/default.jpg,1439,#video,"Incred money : https://incredmoney.app.link/AkashBanerjee

2024 has been a tough year for some of India's biggest startup founders. @paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma / @OlaElectric's Bhavish Agarwal / @byjusclasses' Byju Ravindran - they all had to be bite the dust and pay for their overconfidence. Some of the biggest names in their industry are looking at rebooting or facing a shutdown. @OYO's Ritesh Agarwal however is trying to chart a different course - when the going got tough - he hunkered down and saved Oyo from going into ICU. 

While Oyo's worst may be behind him - question still is - can Ritesh Agarwal save Oyo from the fate of other hyped up startups like Byjus?

His permission to Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russia has opened a dangerous new chapter in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Putin has also stepped up the offensive by radically altering Russia's Nuclear Doctrine and firing hypersonic missiles into Ukraine. With no one willing to back down - any resolution got tougher - while the world took another step closer to a global war.

Bishnoi allegedly told the police that he wants to become ""the Number 1 criminal in the country""...that may be happening as we speak - all of last week - Lawrence Bishnoi grabbed national/International headlines and also garnering a lot of 'fan following' in India. 

How does a gangster - who's spent a decade behind bars - become the Don of New India??? How does he keep in touch and instruct his 700 odd shooters all over the world ?? How much protection is Lawrence getting and who's dirty work is he doing???
 
The rise of Lawrence Bishnoi and his popularity is also the story of India and how we choose our icons - what we see as good or bad. Who's next of Bishnoi's hit-list???

WATCH - Who Killed Baba Siddique? | Lawrence Bishnoi Vs Salman Angle A Distraction? | - https://youtu.be/EtaloHG_m-Q

Relations between India and Canada have sunk to a new low - some serious allegations have been made against the Narendra Modi Govt. While the Govt of India has hit back hard - a lot of questions remain unanswered ... including the role of Lawrence Bishnoi who has been in Indian jails for a decade.

Who's speaking the truth and why would Justin Trudeau do this for domestic political gains? Why did India accept the same allegations when made by America??

Could it be true that Gangster Bishnoi's only aim in life is to punish Salman Khan .... or that is just a story to expand his empire in Mumbai??? 
Siddique's brutal end - tells a story of greed and ambition - of a gangster who's just grown in statue - WHILE IN PRISON FOR A DECADE!

Its a story of the failure of the state and one that should ring alarm bells in Mumbai.

In an election - that was widely believed to lead to a hung house - the people of the state have given a clear mandate to National Conference and its allies. The ploy to have a massive number of 'independents' to spoil the game - did not work. 
However now the split between Jammu and Kashmir - is even more wider - Jammu going to the BJP and Kashmir to Cong-NC. But like Haryana - Congress continues to struggle in a direct fight with the BJP - winning ONLY ONE seat in BJP dominated Jammu.

How BJP Stumped Congress & Won Haryana For A Record 3rd Term | Akash Banerjee & Mohit,YB2J88x0apk,2024-10-08T15:25:26Z,1156004,34045,6864,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YB2J88x0apk/default.jpg,1185,#video,"Ever since Haryana Election results came out - Congress has been crying foul - even hinting at EVM manipulation. Elections can be more uncertain than a T20 game of cricket - that axiom was on fine display as the results of the Haryana Elections came in .... the first major polls since the 2024 Lok Sabha elections  - this was being seen as Congress's chance to cement its return and solidify its narrative....but the grand old party was in for a shocker.  

BJP swept the elections with an even better performance than last time. How did this happen? How did the BJP pull-up in the final lap?? Where did the Congress go wrong (again)....and what does it mean for the elections that are coming up??? Can the Congress hide behind 'EVM Manipulation' - every time it loses - or will it have to do some more serious introspection???

Why has the Modi govt failed to start trial - even in the most high profile of cases? Why is Umar Khalid in jail despite Govt having 4 YEARS to start a trial? Wither the BJP Govt is scam / riots and terror friendly .... or it never really had any evidence - the idea was to just jail political opponents.

Did the box office performance of these movies predict the decline of BJP's formula on using nationalism and religion to garner votes? Did the Bollywood Box office do a much better job of predicting the election results than 'elaborate' EXIT POLLS?

For all the moral grandstanding and lectures on Democracy - the US Elections itself turning into a circus. Forget matters of national or global importance - this election is all about age / rage / gender & slander. Suddenly the oldest constitutional democracy in the world has run out of leaders / issues / statesmanship.
Here is how the election campaign has shaped up - till now. Given that elections will be in November - it can only get wilder from here!

NOTE - Its been 24hrs+ since many news channels & social media handles screamed about systemic abduction / rape & genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh- YET the Govt did not say anything about this strongly. Why? Is Govt is scared & hiding the truth or once again Godse Bhakts managed fool u with fake news? If you believed in the fake news / videos - then do slap yourself on the head once.

There is little debate that Digital Media and Independent Content Creators had a huge role to play in Elections 2024 - they put their necks on the line and destroyed the narrative control that Modi had over the nation for a decade .... as expected a hit-back was only to be expected.

The Broadcast Bill is a return gift from Narendra Modi to all the content creators who worked tirelessly for years to inform / educate citizens of India. No one asked for this bill - yet the work is working on it 'secretly' - because it wants to shut even small you-tubers who dare to question an authoritarian regime. 

Resources - to know more about the Broadcast Bill and what it means for our democracy & media - refer to the fabulous work being done by Apar Gupta & Nikhil Pahwa

Budget 2024 was 'historic' in a sense - not only the opposition .... even ardent supporters of the Govt went ballistic against Nirmala Sitharaman. Did the Union Budget have a vision? Is this Budget an admission that the Economy is running out of steam? Why does the FM have to depend on China to boost growth?? Has the middle-class been shown a big middle finger???

The Defence Minister alleged that Rahul Gandhi was misleading the Parliament when he said that the Govt. was not paying Agniveers their due - who died in the line of duty. But the Agniveer issues is MUCH bigger....

Why is Agniveer back in the news ?? 
What are army veterans speaking against it ??

Why KILL Is A Wake Up Call For Bollywood | Violent or Visionary? | Akash Banerjee,Ne0TBPSD7iY,2024-07-06T05:21:04Z,1553600,45719,2535,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ne0TBPSD7iY/default.jpg,536,#video,"How can a movie - made on an shoestring budget - beat some of the biggest action movies in India?
What makes Kill so special - that it is first all-out action Indian movie - that is getting a Hollywood remake??? (That too by  Chad Stahelski, director of Hollywood blockbuster franchise John Wick)
Directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat & Produced by Guneet Monga & Karan Johar - KILL has a star-cast you may not heard of - and action that you surely have never seen in an Indian movie. This is a movie that shows that Bollywood can operate at a global stage. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

The hastily put together INDIA Bloc managed to reduce BJP to below a simple majority and shatter any dreams of 400 Paar. 
The election was fought for citizen rights / respecting the constitution / saving democracy - how much of that has happened in the last 30 days? Is democracy in safer hands now? What is the future of Modi and Rahul? - We dig in. 
This episode is dedicated to all the Deshbhakt Family Members who stood by us - though think and thin.

Stuff like this has perhaps not been seen in the last 10 years. 
Rahul called out the misuse of Hinduism by BJP / the alleged favouritism by the Speaker / the plight of minorities / the forgotten state of Manipur & the absolute misuse of state machinery. 
Does this mean the green shoots of re-democratisation are here or the BJP will hit back???

There is no debate over the massive infrastructure push made by Narendra Modi over the last 10 years - there is no doubt either over the need for it - if India has to develop rapidly.
But what is the hidden cost of these shiny new infra projects ... what is the govt not telling us???

He will have to pull along the INDIA Block on one hand and push back against Modi's authoritarianism on the other. 
To make matters worse for Rahul - nothing seems to have changed for the BJP post elections - be it bulldozer justice or legal power-grab.

This is Rahul's biggest test by FAR.

Why does @dhruvrathee get so much support - while creators like @FlyingBeast320 are struggling?,i2Ok6q1v-Js,2024-06-21T13:55:32Z,7387223,451968,7170,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i2Ok6q1v-Js/default.jpg,50,#shorts,"Very important question raised by Gaurav Taneja about Dhruv Rathee's 'control' over internet content & conversation.
A primary reason for this is because most of the 10M+ creators have started to treat their loyal audiences as money making machines. Someone is buying a 10 crore farmhouse, another one has become a snake charmer, while the third one never gets tired of showing off his gold plated iPhone. 
While making money is not a sin - most creators have stopped caring about the struggles of their core audience. (Who wants to anger the Supreme Leader!!) 
That's where Dhruv stepped in and won the trust of Young India - talking about issues that impacts them - rather then showing only a rich lifestyle. For the SAME reason creators like Taneja are feeling the pinch - witnessing a massive stagnation in their online growth....cuz their audience is seeing through the fakeness. 
While no one expects snake-charmers to make videos on NEET & NTA - its disappointing to note that not a SINGLE PEEP from Gaurav Taneja - an IIT alumnus - on the burning NEET issue. Entrance exams is something he could have taken up with authority - rallied support for lakhs of students - in return he could have gained some trust & goodwill....but that would have taken some balls to do and lots of business risk.
Taneja seems to have chosen the easier option - reduce himself to an godi-influencer who gets arrested for a 'party' & trolls Dhruv Rathee....rather than ask tough questions to the Govt on behalf of his core audience.
Enjoy the loot Taneja, but don't grudge others to choose to matter.

This is a development could have have far reaching impact on Indian Politics. But will Rahul be able to keep the heat up? Will Bharat get to see a balanced democracy after so many years???

Ep5. Election Results Cut Modi to Size | Can INDIA Ensure Re-democratisation? | Akash Banerjee,fyBzlgUGugc,2024-06-07T16:00:56Z,1271791,65148,4882,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyBzlgUGugc/default.jpg,1240,#video,"Was 'Modi’s India on the Right Path?' - asked the topic of the Oxford Union Debate - while speaking on the topic I asked two fundamental questions .... 
1. Was it really 'Modi's India' and 
2. can any individual take this great nation away from the path it had set out in 1947? 
Voters in 2024 proved my gut feeling right when they chose to cut Modi to size and shatter his aura of invincibility. However does this mean that democracy is safe? Can Modi still change the destiny of India? What do WE need to do as citizens to sure the re-democratisation of India???

Is Narendra Modi going to be the next Prime Minister of India? Most likely. Did he win Elections 2024? Far from it. From 400 slogan to not even crossing 300 - NDA has been battered - worse the BJP far from the 272 number and now dependent on allies to exist in power. The halo / invincibility and domination of Modi is over .... how did that happen - how did BJP not see it coming??

Worse - on Monday police attested two SERIOR doctors who switched the blood samples of Vedant Agarwal so that he gets clean chit. More than the brutal crash - it is the coverup that continues to shock India. Will Vedant Agarwal still walk away free - just because of a 4 month age gap???

Voter frustration is obvious - some even pledging to vote NOTA... but NOTA is not only a poor choice its a scam that takes away voter rights. Far from helping you express your disappointment with the candidates - it helps the worst of the lot. 

Things can change - NOTA can become a powerful tool in the hands of voters - only one small change needs to be made.

With a poor performance report-card - the BJP seems to be slipping back to its old formula to use Religion as a crutch. Only problem is that the Representation of People Act, 1951 makes this clearly illegal - something that the Supreme Court reiterated in 2017 via a 7 member bench. Yet its the religion card all over again.

While the EC is sleeping on this - here's what you should know about the law and what traps to avoid as an aware citizen.

But Bollywood directors really need to take a hard look at a play called Humare Ram that is setting the theater circuit on FIRE. Not only does it explore new aspects of the Epic Ramayan - it also manages to pass on some of the core values of Bhagwan Shri Ram. Truly a work of art and some amazing acting - only if Bollywood could learn!

Byjus in Edtech and Paytm in Fintech.... both have seen dramatic falls in the last few months - both businesses led by insanely talented & intensely ambitious founders.... but just like in Byjus case - ego & overconfidence got the better of Vijay Shekhar Sharma.
This is the story of the rise and the fall of Paytm - why things would have collapsed anyways - even without the RBI sledgehammer that fell on Paytm Payments Bank. 
So what next for VSS and more importantly - what lessons for the startup industry??

Its arguably the biggest scam in the history of Independent India - not because of the size - but sheer audacity of it. Out in the open - with legal cover - for YEARS now.... companies were being virtually extorted to buy electoral bonds. What was thought to be favours - is now turning out to be brazen extortion under the threat of raids and jail time. Even if this does not have an impact on the elections - this shows where our democracy is heading - into the autocratic gutter

How SBI Mocked Supreme Court of India | Wants To Reveal Electoral Bond Details AFTER 2024 Elections!,iWWUsX_qAJ8,2024-03-04T17:52:32Z,1267602,48502,4508,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iWWUsX_qAJ8/default.jpg,1246,#video,"On the 15th of Feb, the Supreme Court in a landmark judgement, held Electoral Bonds unconstitutional. It was the very instrument that the BJP brought in - allowing it to amass thousands of crores of rupees in 'secret' funding. The SC had directed the SBI to give all the details of Electoral Bond purchases to the Election Commission by the 6th of March and that the EC would publish these details by the 15th of March. 

Now SBI is 'requesting' more time to get this data - time enough for the 2024 elections to get over - so that this information become redundant to the voter. Will the SC swallow this bitter pill or can it at least allow for the biggest donors to be revealed - so that people can make an informed choice???

DUNKI - Movie Review | Will Audiences Like A Raj from 90’s - in Animal Kingdom ‘23? | Akash Banerjee,n_NG0k1-QkU,2023-12-21T15:58:59Z,1437793,45459,2555,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n_NG0k1-QkU/default.jpg,573,#video,"The year 2023 would be undoubtedly remembered for the comeback of King Khan with TWO 1000 crore blockbusters like Pathan & Jawan. But with the return of lover boy Raj in Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki might not give SRK the perfect closing he was hoping for.

There are numerous issues with the movie - despite all the good parts and great intention - the biggest one being that Dunki does not belong to this decade of cinema.

How Hitler Used Attack on Parliament to become 'Supreme Leader' | Akash Banerjee,GVcZqpEqaFY,2023-12-19T17:13:53Z,996481,34242,3498,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GVcZqpEqaFY/default.jpg,813,#video,"On February 27, 1933 a portion of the German parliament “Reichstag” went up in flames... it was seen as an attack on the very heart of Germany and Hitler used this one incident to cement his ABSOLUTE control over Germany. If there is one date that can be pinned when Democracy died in Germany - it was the day that the Parliament was attacked and the events that unfolded after it.
Moral of the story - Democracies are fragile - determined people while the right skills can undo it - with remarkable ease and in no time. 
Have we learnt any lessons from history? Or are we destined to repeat it?

Sam Bahadur - though struggling at the BO - was made with a similar thought process - serve the market with what they WANT .... but given the overdose of nationalism - that ploy may not be working any more.

With virtually no presence in the Hindi Heartland - the Congress got a consolation prize in the form of Telangana. But that will be of little comfort - because with 2024 elections less than 5 months away - this puts a very big question mark over the Congress and the INDIA alliance as well.

But more than the international chatter - Benjamin Netanyahu faces stiff opposition at home - with most already writing his final political obituary. But what makes the youngest and longest serving PM in the history of Israel so vulnerable at home and is that pushing him to be MORE brutal in the war?

Already Gaza Strip has been cut off from food / water & electricity. Will Isreal risk the lives of 2.3 MILLION Palestinians living in Gaza or does it have a better plan to rescue the hostages that Hamas took?

EXPLAINED: India's 'Diplomatic Triumph' at the G20 Summit & One Persistent Problem | Akash Banerjee,Y3cTvh1bvek,2023-09-11T16:23:08Z,684353,27526,2112,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y3cTvh1bvek/default.jpg,895,#video,"While the nation kept waiting for a India Pakistan match - that was not a washout - India scored big at the G20 Summit .... not only did it manage to get a Joint Declaration - that was agreed to by all...it was also able to sideline China that was hoping to downplay India's role in the Global South.

Why is Europe and USA bending over backwards to please India & why despite this massive win - India was embarrassed YET again by one nagging factor???

Ravish Kumar with his skeletal staff still churned out the journalism that questioned the system on Prime Time.
At a time when Ravish got abuses as recognition - at a time it became fashionable to be authoritarian cheerleader - Ravish kept doing what he knew best. Analysing and speaking the blunt truth.

It was in this dark hour that Vinay Shukla decided to document the life of Ravish Kumar and the decent of Indian Media into chaos. 5 years of labour resulted in a stunning documentary called - While We Watched .... 

It has been getting rave reviews abroad - but there is no distributor who's willing to touch this documentary in India. Ironically that itself proves the point of the makers. In this detailed chat with Vinay and Ravish - we get into the making and the message of While We Watched

When was the last time that a Bollywood - big star movie - focused on issues like children perishing in Hospitals and farmers taking their lives due to loan agents?? While in the South this may be common - these issues have no resonance in the North. Jawan seeing the biggest opening in the history of Hindi Cinema - means that Bollywood may just get the strength to grow beyond Us-Vs-Them narrative and do some meaningful cinema while still having all the masala and entertainment.

While such a statement might find resonance in the South in the name of Social Justice …  it has already pushed the INDIA Alliance on the back-foot in the North. The BJP has already made a shill attack - saying that  Udhayanidhi wants to do away with 80% of the population of India - that believes in Sanatan Dharma. 

IN this Deshbhakt Takeover episode - we get in Devdutt Pattanaik to explain what Sanatan Dharma is - what is the linkage with Hinduism - Why Caste and Untouchability needs to be seen separately & how politics is being played over words - just for votes.

This cinematic gem is a courageous and important step towards discussing teenage issues, sexuality & societal relations. 

The film is a masterful blend of entertainment and education, skilfully presenting a subject matter that many might shy away from. Though, Oh My God - 2 is a Akshay Kumar starrer movie - this film rests on the shoulders of the brilliant Pankaj Tripathi.

REVEALED - Ugly Truth behind Mumbai Train Firing & Haryana Nuh Violence | Akash Banerjee,osmTTYKJNJA,2023-08-01T15:40:58Z,1403774,81543,11088,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/osmTTYKJNJA/default.jpg,1555,#video,"Three news stories - three developments within 24 hours - all three showing how its advantage hate now. A hate crime that India has not seen the likes of - on a train from Jaipur to Mumbai. A riot in Nuh by members of the minority community and a retaliation in Gurugram / Delhi NCR. (that could have been stopped) 
A kawariya yatra with a suspicious route - that WAS stopped in Bareilly - resulting in the instantaneous transfer of an honest SSP rank officer. 

The Mumbai Train Firing, the Haryana Nuh Violence, the transfer of an honest officer - all a coincidence - or clear sign that we are headed into an era of peak hate?

The BJP is at war with the acronym INDIA itself - it is worried for a good reason - if there is anything that can stop Modi's third term as CM - it is a united Opposition that is not throttling itself.  

However - as critics point out .... just coming together under a fancy name will not make you challenge the BJP....you need a LOT more, especially when u have 9 months left for the polls. Can INDIA now push forward its own Socio-Political vision for India??? Can it counter the Gujarat / Hindutva Model with a Dravidian Model of Growth with Social Equity?? We dive in deep in this case study to find out!

Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is being called the best movie of 2023 and probably the best biopic ever - but contrary to the hype this movie is not about the detonation of the A-Bomb... its not about the IMAX effects either - what makes this Nolan's finest work is his ability to dive into human character and emotions. Here's breaking down the THREE LEVELS that the movie works on and transports you in time.

Manipur had been burning for now - but few cared - however on gory video changed that. For a day or two Manipur become the focus of national conversation - even the Prime Minister had to break his 79 day MAUN - VRAT to speak on the issue - but even he did not offer much. 

While the first arrests in this case have now been made - its become clear that the Biran Singh Govt was sitting on this case - fully aware of what was happening - hoping that the rest of the country does not wake up to this reality.

We said that the only thing that could stop Modi was the opposition coming together - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-WFvdq29h4

THAT finally seems to be happening - and the naming of the opposition alliance as INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) is truly a masterstroke - it has sent the BJP into a tizzy. But getting the name right is just the start - how much can INDIA dent the NDA and what's at stake here??

Bengal as we will see has a very different makeup and way of operation.

Shocking! - Modi knew about Brij Bhushan’s Ugly Truth & yet didn’t act? | Akash Banerjee & Avishrant,48IMWx6lk6E,2023-06-06T18:46:38Z,1812627,59704,5762,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/48IMWx6lk6E/default.jpg,1053,#video,"It's a stunning bit of claim mentioned in the FIR against Brij Bhushan - that our medal winning wrestlers had even complained to Narendra Modi about Brij Bhushan Singh and his exploitation - YET nothing was done - besides trying to shut up the protesting wrestlers. 

Months after protests against him erupted - Bhushan has not been arrested - forget that - he is yet to step down as President of the Indian Wrestling Federation. But why is the Modi Govt not ejecting him - why is it bending backwards to protect him???? Why so scared of Bhushan??

As many as 300 MILLION jobs could be impacted by the advent of AI ... & India might be one of WORST hit - we have a large base of unskilled youth who are waiting for employment ... but their jobs will be taken by AI. 

On the other hand - NASSCOM says that India is the most AI ready amongst G20 nations. Question is will we be able to pivot and up-skill before the AI tsunami hits us bad???

A LOT of comments saying AI cannot replace humans - (sure not right away) but they are replacing Human Jobs as we speak - https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65631168

EXPOSED!  - How the Supreme Court called out the Lies of Kerala Story | Akash Banerjee,TvcubMcR5js,2023-05-18T17:41:52Z,914480,57648,6418,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TvcubMcR5js/default.jpg,1010,#video,"#TheKeralaStory has already minted 150cr+ and this intervention by the Supreme Court might be a little late in the day - but in a major embarrassment to the movie makers - the SC today ordered that a disclaimer be inserted in the movie - saying that this movie is a fictionalised version of events & that there's no data to back claims being made here. While this will not change the course of the movie on the Box Office - this kills the attempt of the movie makers to portray this as a serious work of cinema and research.

*** 6 months ago we put out a video - running u though the real & the claimed numbers. At that time director SUDIPTO SEN INSISTED that the number was right! ...but when the movie got enough traction - be backed out...perhaps the greatest marketing move!
https://youtu.be/cVZe2G18uuE

*** If u have not watched #TheKeralaStory then u can. Just remember - u are watching a work of fiction with no data to back it & tons of hate politics to serve. It does show the brutal reality of ISIS & then marries it to Kerala using the logic of 3 = 32000.

Will the BJP see the limits to its Hindutva plank...or will it double down on the formula that has worked so well in the North ??? 

This also gives a massive momentum to the Congress for 2024 - question is will it capitalise on this or slip up due to internal wrangling?

It was all these factors at play - that resulted in this terrible tragedy. 

We spoke at length with Tora Agarwala - who covers the North East for The Indian Express. The idea behind this detailed chat is to go behind the headlines and understand how this violence had been building up for some time - how local politicians took the fragile peace of Manipur for granted and how the state has undone a lot of fwd. movement it had achieved.

Indian origin Balesh Dhankhar - high profile head of ""Friends of BJP"" in Australia at one point of time has been found guilty of drugging and assaulting atleast 5 Korean women in a very calculated manner.

What's the religious aspect of this killing?

However now even at the top level - there seems to be agreement that China is the threat to watch out for. But WHAT is the India-China border dispute and is China willing to go to War over an issue that could be resolved diplomatically. 

In this deep dive - we take a look at ALL the hot spots and uncover the real situation along the LAC....and understand the timid response of the Modi Govt to Chinese aggression and arrogance.

In a very public manner - the Modi Govt has shown that it is vehemently opposed to the Collegium System. Is this a plan to again bring in the Govt's favourite - NJAC into law??  While there are major questions about lack of transparency in the appointment of Judges - will NJAC make the Judicial system subservient to the executive - OR that is already happening??? 

It may not be obvious - but a battle is already brewing on over who controls the last standing pillar of India's Democracy - the pillar that ensures that the system of check and balance still exists.... this final battle will decide where our county lands up.

After crackdown on JNU & Jamia - students have been left out in the cold to fend for themselves. Despite numerous reports of scams and cheating - there is not much that powerless students can do or appeal to. 
India today had no student leader or icon .... Perhaps this is exactly what the govt wanted.

The BBC documentary on Modi tried to undermine Indian democracy and insult the nation - when that failed Hindenburg Research was given supari to attack Adani - a pillar of Indian economy ... while we stopped both external attacks ... there were traitors in our midst who went ahead and made Pathaan a mega-hit. Clearly people don't see the dangers of Bollywood.

In an admission in Parliament the Finance Ministry has revealed that just the TOP 50 wilful loan defaulters in India owe banks close to 1,00,000 CORE RUPEES! - Another RTI shows that just 300 defaulters who owe banks more than 100 core each - have a cumulative loan default of 1.4 LAKH CRORE RUPPES. 

Who sanctioned these loans ? How were these bad loan processed ? Why are rules only enforced when a middle class Indian or a farmer comes to ask for the loan? Why is the recovery process different for different people ? Why is the law so radically different for rich and poor (even when the rich default?)

Far too much credit is given to Modi's personal charisma in winning elections. The sheer scale of BJP's unprecedented win in Gujarat was because of the hard work of the cadre and calculations on the ground - there are massive lessons for the opposition parties to learn if it wants to make a dent in the TEN assembly elections that are coming up in 2023. 
Will the Congress learn from the Gujarat debacle???

BJP managed to win 4 of these - TRS, RJD and Sena won the rest. But what is fascinating is how Munugode became a war of egos between the BJP and TRS - money and liquor flowed freely and money to the tune of 10 - 15K per voter is said to have been spent ! The Congress lost its deposit despite Rahul Gandhi's yatra crossing the state - this is why one small constituency election has important signals for all!

There seem to have been slips at multiple levels and now every attempt is being made to shift the blame. While the role of the public and the maintenance company should be looked into - there real responsibility lies somewhere else.

If people don't wake up - this shifting of blame will be successful too.

Just days later Modi blamed Mamata Banerjee for the tragedy and claimed it was God's message to the people of Bengal to save the state from her rule....today just weeks before Gujarat elections - a similar tragedy has struck the state killing close to a 100. 
Should this also be seen as God's message against the BJP and Modi???  How low should one get in politics? Asking for votes over people's dead bodies? - what't the Lakshman Rekha???

But what makes this film special is a compelling storyline that deals with topics like tribal rights, caste oppression, environmental protection and forest land encroachment with stunning visuals and music. 

But what Bollywood is lacking that it is unable to cook such a hit recipe? We analyse this and much more in this episode of The Deshbhakt

The Govt claims that it has enough evidence to merit the banning of this organisation for 5years …. including the fact that it had terror links with ISIS. 

Other parties have welcomed the move but questioned why RSS / Bajrang Dal should not be banned as well? Will the Govt be able to move to court and prove the case and who is the next one to be banned?

India Overtakes Chinas Population! | Time for some tough action? | Akash Banerjee,96BZ5tz2Qgk,2022-08-05T16:17:01Z,503021,29571,2627,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/96BZ5tz2Qgk/default.jpg,905,#video,"India has now overtaken China as the most populated nation in the world. What does it mean for you and me ... ?? Does India urgently need a population control Bill or some other measures to stop a 'population explosion' from happening? Why is the Govt not brining in tough measures? What do the numbers say? Is population the real reason why India is not moving ahead fast???

There is no state that can not be won - no politician who cannot be made to switch sides - no agenda that cannot be set. Yet despite all its efforts - the BJP has precious little to show in the name of progress in South India except Karnataka. Why is this so? Will the next 2 years see a lot more attention to the South???

Enforcement Directorate & PMLA | How Congress & BJP shaped a deadly tool | Akash Banerjee,Inje7ADzIbQ,2022-07-06T12:39:11Z,505630,25615,1379,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Inje7ADzIbQ/default.jpg,900,#video,"Over the last 17yrs - the Enforcement Directorate filed Over 5,400 Money Laundering cases under PMLA Act. It secured only 23 convictions in court - that's less than a 0.5% conviction rate!!! The rise of ED to a super CBI is fascinating. Politicised by the congress - Weaponised by the BJP.

Prevention of Money Laundering Act - A law that was brought in to hack illegal drug trafficking, money laundering & to put a stop to legitimising Black Money has gradually moved on from being a law to a political tool in the hands of the ruling government…be it Congress who politicised it - to BJP that weaponised it. 

A brilliant article in Scroll - https://scroll.in/article/1027571/how-the-modi-government-has-weaponised-the-ed-to-go-after-indias-opposition  - highlights how in the ED has become a force to reckon with & a weapon to intimidate the opposition by the party in power - be in Congress or the BJP. 

Do watch the episode to understand how powerful ED has become after the 2019 amendment & to understand if the PMLA stands constitutionally correct ?

An international plot that was painstakingly hatched & supported by international arms from across the border. Was it 'just' a gang-war .... was it 'just' a revenge killing or a much more sinister plot?  A special investigation.

******************************************

PLEASE NOTE 5 POINTS - 
Moosewala's tragic killing is a very emotive issue - as a fan of Punjabi music I know the power that name carried - therefore its obvious there are many versions of the truth that are floating around. We waited for ONE MONTH for the facts to come out before attempting this video and even now so MANY things are not clear and we are getting many questions .... let me attempt to clarify a few and also ask you for more details. But please note - we always don't have direct contact/sources - we also depend on news sources (we tend to read only the reliable ones) 

1. Shagunpreet was not Moosewala's manager ???
Regardless of a few shows or many - there is a clear link and even the Tribune is saying that .... 
https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-moosewalas-manager-shaganpreet-seeks-anticipatory-bail-in-vicky-middukheras-murder-case-407732

2. There is a clear connect with the Bambiha Gang and the songs are not about birds, there might have been pressure on him - but the songs are there - the lyrics are there.

3. Over the question of AN94 being used...right now the Delhi and Punjab police are fighting over that detail

4. What was his last song before death ??
The Last Ride was released on the 15th of May - and Levels 10 days later - so technically it was Levels

5. Did his father go after him / take his son to hospital ??? 
This is where most of the confusion is - according to the initial police complaint he did trail his sons car & took him to hospital -  though that has been reversed later. We leave you with the clippings to decide.

There is a new sort of fear in the valley and Kashmiri Pundits are exiting in droves - some even calming that the situation is like the 90's. But what is driving this new Kashmiri Pundit Exodus? Why cannot the Govt not stop the hybrid terror attacks on them and are we starting to see the real fallout of Article 370 abrogation now? Kashmir has never been a simple place - and when you try to give it sock treatment - the results are not that great. We explore more.

Did Ajay Devgn assert Hindi as a national language for publicity, or was it illiteracy, or simple insecurity because fact is Bollywood is fighting for relevance at this point of time. More in this episode.

One is the capital of the free world - the other does not even have democracy.... But even then, cities like Dubai have learnt that money is not enough to build long term prosperity. For that you have to have diversity and a culture that unites people from all over the world to work together for greater good. It's a lesson we are forgetting in India - where unity means majoritarianism & the minority is only to be based to earn points....but what will this do to our promised 'vikas' ??

True - The Kashmiri Pandit Tragedy has been a festering would for 30+ years with no clear resolution / justice in sight. Kashmiri Pundits have been continued exploitation by every political party and now their tragedy is being used to sharpen the communal saw. Rather than ensuring a closure - the motive now is to provoke and spread the hate further. We explain why this is dangerous.

The result that emerged had two major national headlines - 
1. BJP's massive win showing how it still controls hearts and minds of citizens 
2. Even bigger - the total Wipeout of the Congress - signalling that after years of rotting, it may be game over for them.

In this episode we take a look at the states that went to polls - the results and why congress crashed everywhere and why this self-destruction has been in the making for some time.

Biggest threat to India - Why are we silent on China? | The Deshbhakt feat PuNsTeR™,sL5El6ZNrc4,2022-02-10T12:57:06Z,412879,26833,1691,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sL5El6ZNrc4/default.jpg,1006,#video,"When it comes to border disputes - we have been very vocal about Pakistan in the past - but every possible indicator says that China poses the biggest threat to India - both militarily & economically. Yet instead of taming the dragon we have been importing 100 billion dollars worth of goods from them and refuse to name and shame their aggressive moves on the border. 

As the international community also wakes up to the dangers of China - the question that must be asked - who will take the lead in taming the dragon? There is only one nation - but that is bust ripping itself apart - giving China more chances to repeat a Galwan.

First 'Sulli Deals' now 'Bulli Bai App' | Will Women be Silenced? | DeshBhakt feat. Sayema Rahman,oVh3-8DwVYs,2022-01-03T14:39:12Z,566378,56220,5155,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oVh3-8DwVYs/default.jpg,653,#video,"First came Sulli Deals where Muslim women were put up for an online ‘auction’ - there was outrage, but sadly no action - as a result we have Bulli Bai - another online auction that aims to degenerate and silence Muslim voices by virtually ‘auctioning’ them. Will this auction - lead to strong action from the authorities?? Or will this go unpunished in the court of law as well? Will this manange to silence Muslim Women who are now being heard internationally??? 
 
In this special DESHBHAKT TAKEOVER - we hand over the microphone to RJ Sayema - one of India's best RJs and a prominent voice who also found her name in the ‘auction’ …. Sayema has a thing or two to say to the authorities and the women who have been named. Do listen up.

Their IAF Mi17-V5 chopper crashed in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday .... final tributes were paid to Gen Rawat today.
Now a Tri-Services Investigation Committee will try to ascertain the exact cause of the accident (that is being seen as one of the WORST in the history of India) but news channels have already speculated on the 'conspiracy' angle & questions have been raised on Helicopter safety. 
For this episode of the Deshbhakt - we spoke with experts to understand what went down, what could have happening and what certainly did not.

The Naga Insurgency is arguably more complicated than even the Kashmir tangle. In this episode we begin with pre-independence India and come down to the present day situation to show how this problem (despite numerous attempts) remains unsolved & has become more complicated.

Question is when will we see more such movies from Bollywood ???

Playing successfully at screens big and small - #Ganjaa has been getting all the attention and eyeballs of people. Starring Aryan Khan, Sameer Wankhede in lead roles - this movie is a commentary on society, substances, politics and the legal system. Analysts are saying that this will compete with DDLJ in terms of trade and longevity. On the Deshbhakt we review Ganjaa - Are you ready to be high?  
In the end however the NCB came and killed the climax it seems - it was all a lie!

Such stammering wouldn't have happened while talking about VD Savarkar. 

Deshbhakt #shorts featuring Avishrant as Gullu's harried producer....imagines just how difficult it would be to be his producer.

Today there might be trends on social media inspired from the Whatsap university that try to demean father of the Nation and increase the influence of his killer Godse but these fake trends cannot change the course of history and facts.

On the eve of his birthday we debunk 5 common myths about Gandhi that have been repeated often enough that they are considered to be true in today’s time.

The same issues that would have brought people to the streets a few years ago - now dont even merit a discussion! We try to understand the concept of this Fakiri that gives people so much understanding, patience and ability to live with ever decreasing standard of life, wealth & opportunities. 

What do you think is the reason why people are so happy - in the face of so many challenges - what's the mantra ????

An eons old belief that is confident, liberal, forgiving and not always comparing to the 'other'. Also discussing the controversy surrounding the 'Dismantle Global Hindutva' conference.

While Yati has been known to generate a lot of controversy (and FIRs) on a regular basis - this time he went too far and talked about women leaders of the BJP in the worst possible way. We take a look at what the former Chemical Engineer said, what it is not surprising considering his history and why he will still get away with it in light of the divisive politics that is being played in India and Uttar Pradesh.

Despite #BhaktBanerjee's best attempts at having a dialogue - Mr. Tikait took full aim at #NarendraModi - claiming that he's fooling the nation, its people and his party too!!!

One of the hallmarks of the Modi Govt was the ability to keep Inflation under control - something that the Congress failed to do in the years leading to the 2014 debacle. However with the economy sliding down over the years and crude getting expensive - the govt has lost its grip over this essential element that controls public sentiments ( via their wallet) In this episode of the Deshbhakt we find out why everything is getting so DARN expensive and was this because of something that the Govt. did.

Explained - Population Control Bill | Masterstroke or Jumla? | Akash Banerjee,OpEIwKKGqRQ,2021-07-15T14:07:07Z,655038,47814,4144,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OpEIwKKGqRQ/default.jpg,807,#video,"🇮🇳 SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE VIDEOS 🇮🇳  - https://www.youtube.com/thedeshbhakt ▶️

After years of claiming that our population is our strength - that we will become the industrial hub of the world BECAUSE of our young population - now suddenly Population has become a big cause of concern and the reason for our failed 'Vikas' (or since there are no jobs to be given) 

Uttar Pradesh is leading the charge under CM Adityanath - and the Population Control Bill is supposed to be a gamechanger (read Masterstroke) .... question is for what - the people or the approaching UP Elections?? ;)  

How are elections related to this Bill and is it true that a particular community is responsible for the bulk of population rise in India ???? This episode is a fascinating study in contrast - between facts/data on the ground and the politics that is being played over it!!!!

BJP gives Too Much Democracy!

There are many who believe that a second emergency is already underway under #Modi, just that its an undeclared one. #BhaktBanerjee steps in to challenge the notion that there is any sort of an emergency - he argues on the contrary - that there is too much Democracy when you compare what the Congress has done!!! You will find it hard to disagree with BB (or maybe not!) :)))

Narendra Modi’s India: From a ‘Rising’ to a ‘Setting’ Superpower? |The Deshbhakt with Akash Banerjee,bixP-Da3GY8,2021-05-25T15:01:24Z,1733203,159474,18823,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bixP-Da3GY8/default.jpg,1120,#video,"As Narendra Modi completes 7 years in office with one of the largest electoral mandates in the history of India - the country finds itself divided and at war with itself. Where did we go so wrong ???that the rising star of the world - both democratically & economically is today a case study in rising  authoritarianism and sinking economy...
In this episode of The Deshbhakt we take a look at how India abandoned the highway to prosperity and took the narrow path of hate & bigotry. How citizens high on ultranational slogans didn't even see the iceberg of reality when it right there. We also address the question - what can be done now?
Comments welcome.

Now she's gone global - with the international media mocking her claim that she's Covid free because she drinks #Gaumutra or Cow's Urine. On one hand #NarendraModi is trying to push for vaccination - on the other - folks like Pragya are promoting Mumbo Jumbo. Time to stop this dangerous practice of fooling people - while rushing to the hospital themselves at the  first sign of trouble.

10+1 Tips on Fighting Corona (Why it requires a lot of Help & Privilege) | SNL with Akash Banerjee,LrE-9jPJLY8,2021-05-15T17:40:39Z,164307,9628,354,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LrE-9jPJLY8/default.jpg,3948,#video,"Exactly a month since I was hit by Corona - still on the road to recovery. But this past one month has shown me just how much support you need to overcome Corona (even if u are lucky enough not to need O2 or a Hospital bed) Even if you are amongst the lucky 85% who recover at home - there is a lot that needs to be done there too....and it's better to be prepared when u know this may hit you any time (not even talking about the THIRD WAVE!) 

I had the privilege of family support and good advice from doctors - will share a few hacks with you and what you should have ready ANYWAYS - because this mess is far from over. It's been a month of staying away from SNL and i have missed you guys as much....

Thanks to your support and that of members - we have cracked 2 million subscribers. Without YouTube members and those on www.patreon.com/thedeshbhakt - this would have been impossible 

Here is the quick access to the 10+1 Tips! 

0:00 - My experience with Covid
5:30 - MOST CRITICAL - know a good Doctor
7:44 - Does your Pharmacy have Covid medicines?
9:21 - Early Detection can save you from Hospitalization 
10:20 - CT Scan's a critical for those in need
11:08 - Dont worry about Fever (worry about O2 levels)
11:50 - The Privilege of 'Home Isolation'
13:41 - The Privilege of someone to help you
15:35 - Food (as important as medication) 
16:01 - Oximeter / Steaming / Nebulization - your new BBF
16:47 - Post Covid Awareness (where people slip)  
18:12 - This is a Mental battle as well.

Bhakt Banerjee knows why Narendra Modi is taking it easy and not even halting the #CentralVista project - because Modi knows people much better than the liberals do. Because people have been forgiving Modi for all that he has messed up over the last 7 years - why should this be different?

What was the BBMC bed scam and how did Tejasvi Surya's communal plan fail this time??? Was it because people understood the communal card early for a change and that there is was threat of police action?

In this episode of Deshbhakt we also try and answer a deeper question - how does one stop hatemongers and bigots...(from politicians to family members)....by being polite or by calling them out brutally and bluntly. Let's find a way to stop people who will play communal politics - even in the middle of a pandemic.

The #SecondWave was expected but we let it come anyways - unprepared. 
Government was more interested in making an international statement - rather than saving its own people. But this crisis was one year in the making - from finding the 'religion' of Corona to allowing lies and superstition to rule the roost. Here is how we slipped down the rabbit hole.

But one year after the pandemic crept into our lives (and brought out the best and the worst in us) - we sit down with the man to understand the method and the art of giving. With brutal honesty, Sonu shares his giving 'formula' / how giving has given him back a lot more / why others need to step in and give / why he's not looking at politics at this very moment. 

Also what happens to his 'villain' image now? :)

Diljit Dosanjh vs Kangana Ranaut | The Twitter Showdown of 2020 Explained | DB with Akash Banerjee,5cw1lQofuz4,2020-12-04T13:04:04Z,2972097,232219,16759,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5cw1lQofuz4/default.jpg,712,#video,"Twitter saw nothing like this all year - an explosive spat between the champion defender of the BJP Central Govt. #Kangana Ranaut and Punjabi Superstar Singer / Actor #Diljit Dosanjh.... it all started with Kangana spreading fake news about #Farmers and trying to link the protest with Shaheen Bagh.... Diljit would have none of it and slammed Kangana in front of his millions of supporters.

Despite the best efforts of the Queen troll - Diljit kept his point clear and focused - demand an apology from Kangana for calling an aged mother a person 'available' for Rs. 100. 

Kangana's meltdown exposed two things - Bollywood should have exposed her long ago and sometimes u have to get down and dirty to wrestle with trolls.

The Deshbhakt is putting out this special episode to show how people are missing the woods for the trees! How these stunning observations on liberty are NOT just limited to just Arnab and will ensure the release a lot of academics / lawyers / students who are being held by the force of the state.

Prove me wrong. :(

0:00 - Why this was a masterstroke
1:21 - Don't like it dont watch it!

3:39 - SC will have to interfere where needed 
4:26 - Liberty must be protected
5:23 - Abetment to suicide needs ‘actual incitement’

Nikita Tomar Case | Why India needs a SCAW now! Akash Banerjee,BIf9r27auk4,2020-10-29T12:26:33Z,740235,51508,6515,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BIf9r27auk4/default.jpg,586,#video,"A 21 year old #NikitaTomar got a bullet in the head from her stalker #Tauseef because she dared to say to her advances and also lodged a complaint against him. NIkita's family says that Tauseef was related to a Congress politician and was demanding that Nikita convert and marry him. 

While there is a debate on the 'love jihad' angle of the same - there is one thing that has become clear. There is no fear of the law when it comes to crimes against women. That is why Team Deshbhakt is asking the Govt to form a #SCAW Division immediately. The Serious Crimes Against Women Division will track heinous crimes against women and insure that the trial is quick and solid as well. 

Do have a look at this proposal and support us in getting this message to all. 

Chapter Heads -

00:00 - What happened to Nikita 
02:10 - How law and order is mocked by people like Tauseef
02:30 - What is SCAW / Why do we need it now
04:30 - Powers of the SCAW Division 
05:40 - What is the SFIO and how the blueprint is already there
06:20 - We already have OCSAE to safeguard teens 
07:07 - Why we need a long term solution and not short term outrage

'Filthy' - India's Air Pollution Problem & our annual outrage | SNL with Akash Banerjee,pNn2YJ4lN34,2020-10-24T18:07:40Z,76141,4237,169,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pNn2YJ4lN34/default.jpg,5497,#video,"So now our air quality comes up in a US Presidential Debate - but despite the international alarm over India's worsening air quality - we seem to be in a snooze mode. Even here the chalta hai attitude seem to be working - and precious little being done on the ground. 

Every year like clockwork - there are allegations and counter allegations - some assurances are made - some studies are conducted and in the end there is no consensus over what even causes this mayhem!   

ON SNL - we begin with some data and facts that the govt does not want you to know.... then of course your questions!

Remembering the JP Movement & the Right to Protest | SNL | The Deshbhakt with Akash Banerjee,O_xTED4LxIM,2020-10-10T18:10:41Z,105938,6458,184,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O_xTED4LxIM/default.jpg,5493,#video,"11th October is the Birthday of Jayaprakash Narayan, popularly referred to as JP. He passed away in 1979 and was responsible for some of the largest political movements in the history of Independent India. 

Had JP tried his political activism today - he may have been jailed under UAPA and the SC would have told him that he could no agitate in public spaces. 

Yet the JP movement rattled the authoritarian force that Indira Gandhi was - it was his movement that led to IG being thrown out of power post Emergency. The Congress was never the same after JP.    

On the eve of his birthday - discussing dissent & protest on SNL!

Sushant: A final closure after the AIIMS report? | SNL | The Deshbhakt | Akash Banerjee,JV9ExyiuN40,2020-10-03T18:17:59Z,199214,11478,509,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JV9ExyiuN40/default.jpg,5855,#video,"After more than a 100 days of relentless media coverage (and really little actual progress in the case) now comes the news that AIIMS has ruled out any murder angel to Sushant Singh case. 

Question is will AIIMS now be discredited?
Will new angles come up again? 
Or will incidents like Hathras get some of the outrage and attention??? 

ON SNL we take up this issue and try to understand what will we outrage for the next 50 or 100 days???? + your questions as always!

Chetan Bhagat: We have to stop dreaming of greatness & get to work! | Deshbhakt Conversations,sY3C0BlGPrw,2020-10-02T06:15:01Z,488058,30616,3802,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sY3C0BlGPrw/default.jpg,3795,#video,"Like him or not - agree with him or disagree - but Chetan Bhagat speaks his mind. He does not shy from a fight and is open to correcting his POV as time goes by. In this extremely frank and blunt video-podcast - Bhagat talks about how social media is distracting an entire generation, (why Gandhi may have failed to rally the young if the British had 4G!) .... also why we should stop daydreaming about our 'greatness' and actually get down to work.

Does Chetan Bhagat consider himself a 'Modi Fanboy' and when did he start becoming critical of the Govt again? Bhagat also discusses his writing - his new (and 9th) novel - One Arranged Murder and why creative pursuits look easy - but involve a lot of legwork.

This is the India that Mahatma Gandhi did not want us to become.

Manmohan Singh - A Nation in 69 remembers a man of 88! | SNL | The Deshbhakt | Akash Banerjee,N4qgATcQp00,2020-09-26T18:22:17Z,1829809,24806,1043,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4qgATcQp00/default.jpg,5981,#video,"Six years ago - today we would have been a flood of jokes on Manmohan Singh - but not today. In fact to the contrary - many miss his quiet demeanor and ability to steer the nation in difficult times. Many (including myself) find that we judged the man too harshly - and while the Congress has still a lot to answer for - MMS clearly is being judged a lot more kindly than 6 years ago. We remember the highlights of his career that give us economic liberalization (as FM) and double digit GDP growth (as PM)

Also your questions, from Bollywood under fire to Deepika Padukone and Sara Ali Khan being questioned. From Anil Ambani facing the questions from court to the Farmers questioning the Farmer Bill!  

00:00 - Happy Birthday Dr. Manmohan Singh !
20:09 - Dr. MMS used to answer every question in Press Conference, can we expect the same from current PM?
23:05 - Why did I not vacate the office in lockdown?
30:50 - Implementation of government policies : Emperors new clothes !
37:55 - Farmers being handed over to Private organizations.
45:15 - Umar Khalid case - 11 Lakh pages !!!
51:28 - Do I feel safe in today's times?
1:17:54 - Why India is Quasi-federal?

Farmers have been protesting against the Govt since the new farm bills 2020 have been passed but their protest was falling on to deaf ears until recently when 'Delhi Chalo' agitation began. But why are these farmers protesting against the bill when the plan was to help them and double their income? The Farmers bill is a complex issue - with a lot of history. On the DeshBhakt we try to explain the MAIN contention point - with some help from Lego blocks :)

Lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan has been hitting the headlines of late (again) - this time for 'scandalizing the court' and posting tweets that were in 'contempt'. Be it mocking the present CJI SA Bobde for sitting atop a 50 lakh bike or raising questions over the actions of past 4 SC Chief Justices....Prashant Bhushan has been relentless in questioning the judicial system.  

After a lot of heated arguments and asking for a sorry - the top court fined him a grand total of Re 1. While the verdict can be termed as a moral victory for Bhushan, the case left the country pondering over the current state of judicial system and many are raising questions over the working of the courts.

This Teachers Day - Prashant Bhushan sits down with us for a detailed conversation and lesson in civic duty. Prashant talks in detail about the judicial system, freedom of speech, his fallout with Arvind Kejriwal and much more.

India's gross domestic product or GDP contracted by a massive MINUS 23.9% in the April-June period, that is what the official NSO data said. The data revealed that majority of the sectors are hit by a negative growth after the lockdown - making this the worst economic stump in India and also the in the world amongst big economies.

However in this edition of the deshbhakt we are going to take a look at how India's GDP was anyways on a downward spiral BEFORE the virus struck - making the cut deeper for India than any other country. Even before the lockdown, GDP growth was declining since the last eight quarters.

The Finance Minister has already said that this time, the decline in growth is an ‘act of God’ - however data shows that an act of Fraud has been committed and this depression is not going away any time soon.

He is also disliked in equal measure by a vast section of the population - for this stinging critique of the Government and probing questions.

With Bihar Elections around the bend, an opposition that has collapsed, democratic institutions that have just given up - we sit down with Ravish for a extended fireside chat on what is going on in India and where we are headed. 

From Politics to People - Elections to Entertainment ... Ravish touches on everything in this inimitable style and candor. In Part 1 of this 2 hour long conversation - Ravish also comes down heavy on citizens as well .... the class that has lost its voice and its ability to see clearly. He refutes the claim that the job of opposition is only for the parties.

02:19 - Who is Bablu?

Why Prashant Bhushan Refused to Apologise to the Supreme Court | The Deshbhakt with Akash Banerjee,kMR0rm46YrI,2020-08-20T15:11:21Z,778659,65716,7362,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kMR0rm46YrI/default.jpg,928,#video,"JOIN this Channel as a DeshBhakt Member to get access to perks/chats/discord server/content/podcasts

In a day of dramatic developments in the Supreme Court of India - Prashant Bhushan stood his ground when asked if he would consider an apology. Not even wanting the extra days that were being offered for a ‘rethink’ - a combative Bhushan said ""I do not ask for mercy. I do not appeal for magnanimity. I cheerfully submit to any punishment that the court may impose.”

In this special episode of the deshbhakt we recreate what happened in the apex court (since sadly - proceedings are still off-camera) Bhushan clearly is now ready to face action because he says that his core complaint and explanations were not heeded to. Will the court now find a way out in 2 days - will Bhushan’s point be heard - or will other voice be drowned! Also important to hear how arguments are carried out in the top court (detailed article / tweets attached below) 

Now the SC has given Bhushan time till August 24 to submit an unconditional apology - failing which the court will pronounce it's order on punishment to be handed down to Bhushan.

The Stunning Silence of Arvind Kejriwal | Analysis by Akash Banerjee on The Deshbhakt,qVvXq80C7S4,2020-07-10T12:25:01Z,642134,49728,6775,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qVvXq80C7S4/default.jpg,630,#video,"Once known as a 'revolutionary leader' in #IndianPolitics..... today (after a string of U-Turns) finds himself in a locked cage with nowhere to go. In the last few months, Arvind Kejriwal has deliberately avoided commenting or criticizing the Government on major issues such as Article 370 and CAA. After winning the Delhi elections in February this year...Kejriwal has become a voice that echoes what Modi or Amit Shah has to say. Also Kejriwal's report card has been questable of late - especially when it comes to handling the medical crisis in the capital. 
 
In this Episode of the DeshBhakt, we discuss the shift in Kejriwal’s political strategy over the years and try to figure out where exactly did Arvind Kejriwal lose his ‘significance’ in Indian Politics....and why exactly is he so quiet???

"Why are old neighbourhood allies, turning against India?? | DeshBhakt Analysis with Akash Banerjee",kQ7vzaMuv9I,2020-07-03T12:29:55Z,810702,60943,11599,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kQ7vzaMuv9I/default.jpg,728,#video,"Episode Chapters:
00:00 - India's Neighbourhood
02:38 - China: Goons in Galwan 
03:58 - Nepal: A friend turned Foe 
05:02 - Bangladesh: Signs of insecurity?
06:25 - Indonesia and Malaysia: Cutting criticism 
07:02 - Pakistan: Bleeding India with 2000 cuts 
07:40 - Sri Lanka & Myanmar: China’s proxy weapons
 
India has been known for adopting  a “neighbourhood first” and a “Look east” policy- wherein we have hoped and aimed towards inculcating better ties with our neighbours and the South East Asian states. The NDA government that came to power in 2014 also carried forward this legacy and shared the same ideology.

However, the last few months have heralded a new, but alarming chapter in our peaceful approach. Relations with countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indonesia- which were extremely tranquil- have now begun to sour. 

Meanwhile, the progress that we seemed to have made with our adversaries, China and Pakistan, have also diminished. In this episode of the Deshbhakt, we try to understand what issues led to the weakening of ties between India and its neighbours and what role did China have to play in all this disorder.....also - what were we doing when China was making its moves.

03:58 Has BJP put an end to the “Family Trend”?
09:24 Nepotism in the regional parties :(
 
Despite being a democracy, the Indian political space has been dominated by certain families and ruling 'dynasts' .... Year after year, we see their numbers rising in both the Centre as well as at the state legislatives.  The Congress is held responsible for the genesis of this problem ... #NehruKiGalti (!!) and the BJP/NDA government was hailed as a liberator....a party that will respect only merit. 

But has the BJP truly done that?

In this episode of the Deshbhakt, we try to find out whether the conundrum of dynastic politics has indeed been solved by the BJP? What about other regional parties? Are they any better than the Congress when it comes to Nepotism? Could nepotism be one of the reasons why democracy is slowly being throttled in India?

Emergency In India - Part 2 (How Quickly Democracy can Crumble) | Akash Banerjee,XdIJqjU1TR0,2020-06-24T12:30:13Z,458951,38650,2768,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XdIJqjU1TR0/default.jpg,897,#video,"When the press is censored, students are detained, opposition is absent, and the country is going through a state of emergency...it is democracy that suffers. 

When the Prime Minister considers himself as the ruler; any voice of dissent is crippled and fundamental rights are being denied. 

We have seen throughout the course of history how an overbearing leader drunk on power and fame can take steps that lead to democratic upheaval. Not very far ago in history - we had the National Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi - question is - have we learnt anything from that lesson? 

In this episode of TheDeshbhakt, we’ll talk about the  Emergency that has left a permanent stain on Indian Democracy. It has been 45 years since then and we are forgetting the lessons that Emergency taught us. Watch the full episode to find out why we need to revisit Emergency 1975 in 2020.

Emergency In India - Part 1 (When the Supreme Court let us Down) | Akash Banerjee,C7P7OGhLiy0,2020-06-09T13:05:00Z,599049,57878,4378,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C7P7OGhLiy0/default.jpg,860,#video,"Whenever there is an emergency like situation in the country and the fundamental rights of citizens are threatened - it's the Supreme Court that steps in to protect our rights / democracy and the constitution. 

But when the judiciary fails to perform its duty, all democratic institutions can come under the influence of a powerful government and the fundamental rights of citizens go for a toss....There also have been instances when various High Courts fought for the rights and security of every citizen of the country; but the Supreme Court overruled such judgements and failed to provide justice.

This Deshbhakt Special Educational Episode - takes a look at the darkest hour of the Indian judiciary - when even the apex court failed to live up to the values enshrined in our constitution.....so the Supreme Court of India fallible ??? Let's find out!!!

We begin this SNL with something special and unique - a LOT of deshbhakts - from around the world ask - how can we help in the ongoing migrant crisis in India. There are lakhs of migrants still waiting to go home and trains are full to the brim 

This is where NGO like Karwan e Mohabbat come in - they have been doing some great work - feeding and sending migrants home on busses free of cost. (because most dont even have that sort of money)  

Harsh Mander is a name we all know and he has been doing some great work for the voiceless. So tonight we have him on SNL and we can discuss - what next - in India's worst internal migration crisis ever.  

+ your questions as always in the second of SNL!

#BoycottChina - Can India’s wallet beat China’s bullet? | Akash Banerjee,bdR4DnShFu4,2020-06-06T13:04:23Z,1010547,97427,12391,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bdR4DnShFu4/default.jpg,706,#video,"Massive outrage followed after thousands of Chinese troops entered the Indian territory in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.  While the Indian Government initially denied all claims of any dispute with China, the situation on the border has only got more tangled. 

After the Ladakh Stand-off, a widely popular call for boycotting Chinese products went around. The aim? - to teach China a lesson.
 
Education reformist Sonam Wangchuk came up with a video in which he asked Indians to boycott Chinese apps within a week and Chinese products in a year. But sadly the situation between India and Chain is much deeper than toys and phones ... For Example most of our startup system is funded by Chinese money. 

In this Episode of The DeshBhakt, we raise a few fundamental questions:

- Is boycotting Chinese products the best option available to us?
- Which country will it affect more- China or India?
- What is a better approach towards the issue?

***** India vs China- Chapter Heads :***** 

1:33 - Logic Behind the Call               
1:54 - China China everywhere       
6:53 - How to escape the dragon
7:23 - Diversify Imports
7:36 - Rectify Mistakes, Increase FDI
7:52 - Better ecosystem for Businesses
8:24 - Atmanirbhar Defence
9:03 - Need to be China's Alternative

Bhakt Banerjee EXPOSES Gourav Vallabh (Something that Sambit could never do🙄) | Part 1The DeshBhakt,NI7i7PG7yUY,2020-05-23T06:30:11Z,615267,48282,3565,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NI7i7PG7yUY/default.jpg,1733,#video,"Bhakt Banerjee is BACK and HOW! Till now he was following orders of the supreme leader and was keeping his social distance (especially from Congis and Libtards) ....but now he has had ENOUGH. In his first post lockdown interview - Bhakt Banerjee takes on the most powerful and forceful Congress Spokesperson - Gourav Vallabh....A man who even Sambit Patra has not been able to sidetrack. 

But Bhakt Banerjee is a different breed - will Gourav be able to survive this onslaught and be able to answer his probing questions on Rahul Gandhi / Congress's lack of vision / their issues with everything and solutions will nothing. This is an epic face-off - so watch / share comment.

10 Lessons in Nationalism that would make Tagore Anti-National today | TheDeshbhakt | Akash Banerjee,bqY6DlBr7dc,2020-05-08T16:26:47Z,640970,62484,5451,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bqY6DlBr7dc/default.jpg,1035,#video,"Rabindranath Tagore has been the most celebrated poet and intellectual in pre-independence India. The creator of our national anthem is known to have controversial thoughts regarding nationalism and patriotism. In his book Nationalism, he talked openly on how nationalism corrupts the population to gain power while the ultimate object of unity and equality is left behind. He was also an ardent defender of dissent and was known to have questioned even the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi. In today’s India, where dissent and disagreement are considered anti-national and nationalism has become a proof of your identity, will the Nobel Laureate Tagore himself be considered anti-India, a member of Tukde-Tukde gang?

On the 159th birth anniversary of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, we’ll talk about 10 most important and most controversial thoughts of Tagore on Nationalism. Watch the full episode of TheDeshbhakt to see why Bhakt Banerjee is angry with Tagore. 

********* CHAPTERHEADS*******

2:17 - Nationalism - A Virus!!!!??? 
3:47 - A Nation is not to be Worshipped
4:52 - Seditious Thinking of Tagore

7:35 - Where the Mind is Free... (so are we?)
9:15 - Tagore against Indian 'History'

But decades down the line there is a worldwide resurgence of authoritarian governments using the same tricks and strategies that were witnessed in Germany ... so many years ago. An army of people working to spread propaganda, to cripple voices of dissent and blaming a community to blame for the country's ills. 

Hitler may be gone - but is the ideology he mastered - coming back to haunt us ??  Are we seeing many countries making the same mistake?? Many being unable to see the same signals that were there in the Germany of 1930s ???

In April - as the crackdown on the CAA protestors got underway - he sat down for a 90 minute - unfiltered Q & A session 

Umar Khalid KNEW that he would be probed under UAPA - but the former JNU student leader was unfazed .... over the course of this livestream Khalid took any and every question (including how he may be helping Modi build a narrative) .... 

The first 30 minutes of this interview are questions sent in from our patrons and youtube members - 
at https://www.patreon.com/thedeshbhakt & https://www.youtube.com/thedeshbhakt/JOIN
The next 60 minutes are just direct questions on Superchats as they came in. 

I would also like to thank our members and subscribers for their support in such a tough time - today we also touched 2 lakh subscribers on Instagram!!! - you can log in there as well - https://www.instagram.com/akashbanerjee.in/

It may have taken a week to come - but today Nirmala Sitharaman announced a 1.7 lakh crore bailout - focused at the poor. But will that save the millions on the streets and what about the middle class who have been left with no money to pay EMI's ??  

Not the News at 9pm chats with Vivek Kaul to break the Bailout package down and to understand why and where more is needed.

Now that India has suddenly realised the gravity of the situation and is closing everything - from trains to cities - can the Govt please give us more data of what is really happening? And EVEN NOW we are making people believe that banging plates is going to solve the problem. (BTW more this 'gratitude' - docs need kits and equipment to do their jobs!)

Paid Media vs People of Delhi - Is free / subsidised utilities good governance or 'Mufatkhori'??,Wsmtsu8Esyc,2020-02-12T14:42:56Z,3156573,170460,12408,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wsmtsu8Esyc/default.jpg,235,#video,"Subscribe karke BELL ICON dabaya kya?! :) - https://www.youtube.com/thedeshbhakt
****************
Arvind Kejriwal may have won the Delhi CMship for a third time - but after trying to mat him on the question of Pakistan / Biryani and CAA - the new allegation against him is that Kejriwal won Delhi on the basis of 'freebies' and that the population of Delhi is 'mufatkhors' or lovers of things free - so much so that they will vote for Imran Khan if he gives them free goodies.

At a time when delivering free utilities like public transport is a growing global trend - desperate anchors are trying to make their masters happy by making voters into villains - but the people of Delhi will have one bit of this. Team deshbhakt asked Dilliwallas what they thought of Sudhir and his 'Mufatkhor' charge!

Hindutva Will Destroy Us! - Ramachandra Guha Vs Bhakt Banerjee,ZpbDlSOqZRY,2020-01-21T16:13:13Z,657052,35710,3280,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZpbDlSOqZRY/default.jpg,2376,#video,"***** CHAPTER HEADS********

4:20 - The Golden Rule of Indian Politics
7:08 - Nehru - ""Greatest danger to India is the RSS""
11:18 - RSS and Indian Freedom Movement? Any Links?
13:54 - Gandhi was responsible for the Partition?
16:09 - Can RSS be compared to Hamas!?
19:46 - Why is Ram Guha Anti-CAA?
27:25 - Why Ram Guha is scared of Hindutva?
30:06 - Guha - ""Hindutva will destroy us""
31:31 - What is the importance of Gandhi today?
34:36 - Guha - ""Savarkar gave ideological direction to Godse""
36:37 - Guha ""Like Indira Gandhi was Iron lady - Modiji is Iron Man""
39:33 - If not Modi than WHO?

****************************
In one of the biggest Interviews of the year...Bhakt Banerjee goes up against noted historian (and celebrated Urban Naxal) - Ramachandra Guha. Dr. Guha recently appeared to redeem himself when he called Rahul Gandhi a 5th Generation Politician that young India didn't want. 

Expecting to convert Ram Guha to Modi's side BB sits down with the man - only to discover that Guha continues to be as negative about Modi and the RSS as he always was. EVEN saying that Hindutva will destroy the nation and that RSS can be compared to Hamas!!!! 

However on the question of Gandhi and Nehru - Bhakt Banerjee corners Guha and also the question of ignoring Savarkar's role in our freedom struggle. 

Watch his biggest battle that BB has fought for the history of India and SEE WHO WINS!!!!

The call initially made by Atal Bihari Vajpayee - was recently made again by BJP during Maharashtra Elections. The party has always been hailing Savarkar as the 'bravest' and ideal freedom fighter but there are certain facts about this great leader which no BJP or even Hindu Mahasabha leader shall ever tell you.

In this episode of The Deshbhakt, we revisited the life and ideology of VD Savarkar and discovers how brave he really was.....

This is not the first time when the Government has tried to excuse itself from any governance failure.
 
It seems to be a policy now - to divert people from real issues - using false narratives....from Hindu Khate Mein Hain to Khan Market Gang. The liberals too spend most of their time frothing other such name calling. 

In this episode of the Deshbhakt, we take a 5 year view of all the catchphrases that were developed by the IT Cell and the public got fooled and distracted form core issues!

The reason why ISRO will bounce back from this setback -is because from the start, ISRO had learnt how to deal with failure. It has been ISRO's habit to back come stronger after its failures.
Ep.108 of The Deshbhakt takes a quick look though 50 years of ISRO to find out how odds and failures were beaten back at EVERY step of the way to today - where India is a space superpower.

With a deteriorating economy, India's job crisis is expected to worsen in the coming future. Even engineers, doctors & MBAs are struggling to get jobs in their respective fields.

However, market condition is not the ONLY factor for India's jobs crisis. Lack of skills amongst graduates and increasing automation in the market has also resulted in joblessness. Unemployability in India is serious concern and has been caused due to bad policy / teaching and colleges.  

Our Teachers Day Special - Episode 107 of TheDeshBhakt, we take a look at the unemployability crisis and how upskilling using tech could be a possible solution. That education system has failed to educate the masses is not a secret - but can technology step in to bridge the gap?????

From his ‘leftist’ tilt to this unending questions to the administration to why he cannot also become a Nationalist like others. 

Was the Magsaysay award winning journalist able to handle BB, Was he able to convince BB that he had nothing to do with the Khan Market Gang,
Did he explain his ‘Anti-Modi’ stance …?

*****************************************************************************
Today India's economy is in serious trouble - already in the ICU - now has to face a global challenge. But the scale of our economic meltdown could have been reduced if we acted earlier - the warning signs have been there for a long time and all key indicators went south 9 months ago. But we kept saying Saab Changa Si! 

In August 2019 we made this episode that took a hard look at Demand - Investments - Job losses - Rupee is getting weaker - Stock market is getting battered. HAD the Government focused on reviving the Indian economy instead of focusing on popular politics, we would have been better today. But for that the Govt. first needed to admit that there was a crisis.

(and how attempts are being made even today)

Every year, we celebrate Independence day with pride and fervour, but we want to bury the memories of partition and the cost at which Independence was served. Partition of India and Pakistan is a dark chapter in the history of the subcontinent - something we would like to forget.

The DeshBhakt, we track the years before partition, what caused the rift between Congress and the Muslim League - how the British were successful in dividing us -  and why we are STILL not learning the lessons of Partition.

The Left Parties have been virtually reduced to zero with no hope in sight. 

What happened to a force that commanded 60 MPs just a few years go and controlled UPA1? - we sit down with Sitaram Yechury to have an honest fireside chat and understand what went wrong with the Left?

Tons of questions sourced from Social Media and especially - patreon.com/thedeshbhakt. 

While Sitaram does answer the questions with remarkable honestly and admission of slipping - question is DOES HE HAVE  solution to making the Left the voice of the oppressed and the working classes?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEfIMHjKp-c&t=2s

In Episode 100 (Part 2) of TheDeshbhakt, we explain the plight of Kashmiri Pandits, the origin of insurgency in Kashmir, AFSPA, and possible solutions the Modi Government can take in order to solve the Kashmir problem. Also the voice we need to hear the most - but dont. 

Kashmir issue, ever since independence, has been a sensitive topic, even though real information is scarcely consumed. In Part of this series we covered the history and struggle of Kashmir, Article 370 and Article 35A...we tried to understand why despite decades of intervention - why the Kashmir conflict remains unsolved.

By no means, this is a complete history of the state - just an attempt to explain some knotty issues / keeping facts in mind and going easy on the emotions.

"Understanding Kashmir: History, Article 370 & Article 35a | Ep.100 The DeshBhakt with Akash Banerjee",IEfIMHjKp-c,2019-07-19T12:19:38Z,1945396,95931,13562,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEfIMHjKp-c/default.jpg,1059,#video,"Watch the second part of Understanding Kashmir by clicking the link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiS2xW3tXSw

The Kashmir Issue - ever since independence, has been a sensitive and debatable topic for both India and Pakistan. Despite the emotions surrounding the topic - very few know about the history and struggle of Kashmir.

What is Article 370 and Article 35A?
Why have all parties failed to resolve Kashmir - even after India and Pakistan fighting several wars over it - despite the United Nations intervening - in spite of SEVEN DECADES having passed?? 

In Part 1 of Episode 100 - #TheDeshBhakt; we make an attempt to untangle and explain the Kashmir conflict.

WARNING _ by no means this is a complete history of the state / just an attempt to explain a knotty issue / keeping facts in mind and going easy on the emotions.

Leila Review: 10 Reasons why the Netflix series is too close to todays India | Ep.95 The DeshBhakt,hR3bI7Uifds,2019-07-03T07:21:07Z,576292,41811,5062,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hR3bI7Uifds/default.jpg,680,#video,"Netflix’s latest series Leila has raised a controversy as soon as it got released on June 14. Based on the novel by Prayag Akbar with the same name, Deepa Mehta’s adaptation of this dystopian thriller is facing objections on the name of religion and its over-the-top
authoritarian government. 

But could it be that the REAL problem with Leila is not that it is too extreme - but that it is too real many a times? 

The series is set in a technologically advanced but a radicalised country, Aryavart in the year of 2049. It also outlines the environmental issues like heavy air pollution, water
crisis that can be seen evidently in present scenario too.
DeshBhakt found 10 clear instances when Leila got too close to reality......

With the money from shadow banking sector drying up & the economy tanking - the Real Estate bubble is set for a massive implosion. 

Jaypee Wishtown - that is making the headlines - is just a tip of the iceberg. India's largest real-estate meltdown will see another Jet Airways happen - rendering 20,000 families homeless and robbing them of their life's earnings (including that of my parents) .... with 7 LAKH UNSOLD HOUSES THIS IS MEGA CRISIS WAITING TO HAPPEN. 

As I researched into Jaypee's criminal misuse of funds - i found layers of fraudulent behaviour and shady funding that was kept afloat with the principle - that INDIANS WILL ALWAYS BUY A HOUSE, NO MATTER WHAT THE PRICE. 

This axiom held true for some time - but now karma has come to the bite the industry and the ones to suffer (as always) will be the sorry middle class buyer.

After his cloud & radar theory, Modi has become the subject matter for trolls (not to forget his latest Kedarnath meditation fiasco) 
 
However embarrassing this may seem, all this is intentional!!  People do not understand Modi's logic behind these 'blunders'

In Episode 84 of #TheDeshBhakt, Bhakt Banerjee asks us to see the situation with nuance and reveals the deeper thought behind Modi's statements & actions. Its time to STOP Modi Jokes says BB - because even if you joke about him.... AYEGA TO MODI HI!

From Narendra Modi insulting sanskriti – by dragging Rajiv Gandhi’s name into the election slugfest - to how the Sabrimala issue cannot be looked at only with the lens of Civil Law. 

While the Indian National Congress did take time to bounce back from the 2014 debacle, Tharoor says that the party and Rahul Gandhi has done a lot of good work in terms of leadership and communication. He believes that given the inputs from the first few rounds of polling - the BJP is going to be history on the 23rd of May. 

Tharoor also takes some tough punches on Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, nepotism in the Congress and the Sunanda Pushkar case that the police is dragging its feet on. He also makes a strong point on how Hindutva needs to be seen as the opposite of the Hindu religion - and nothing more than a political ideology. 

Watch Tharoor at his candid best – with questions coming in from social media and from the Deshbhakt toli on patreon.com/akashbanerjee who virtually set the question paper for Tharoor.

Please note - the interview did start on a 'non-political' note, but soon one realised that this is a difficult job to do - so the best is very very political! :)

Once upon a time - News Panels and Debates were boring serious stuff - what Patra did was bring in his own brand of Circus to the Mix. TV Debeats really be remembered as BEFORE Patra era - and after Patra era. Here are 44 of Sambit Patra's best quotes on TV - collated on the occasion of his 44th Birthday!!!!

These 44 gems from Patra's unlimited repository to show you his talent / range and sheer brilliance. Have a good laugh and send a tweet thanking Patra for keeping our democracy and news debates - in such a humorous condition!  Now ofcourse Patra has graduated to the Digital world where he has been caught passing fake letters with claims of #CongressToolKit !

20 Questions to 'Expose' Dhruv Rathee...| The Deshbhakt with Akash Banerjee,w8shi4da4b0,2018-11-14T09:19:15Z,2441793,102179,8274,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w8shi4da4b0/default.jpg,1955,#video,"What makes a 24 year old youtuber so popular on social media? How does a youngster, equipped with nothing more than a mobile phone - garner more than a million subscribers? 

Is this format of news the future or a passing fad?
Does Dhruv represent the 'neutral' POV or he's a Aaptard?
Who funds Dhruv and what is his 'hidden agenda' 

I scanned through hundreds of questions sent by you and narrowed it down to the 20 most pertinent / blunt / useful ones...hope u like the chat - and if there were failings - please do send feedback in the comments! .

Rude American Vs Sanskari Indian Journalists! -  Ep54 #TheDeshBhakt,Qj8CPRdampI,2018-11-10T11:53:03Z,2656019,181421,15037,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qj8CPRdampI/default.jpg,598,#video,"The latest sparring between #JimAcosta & #DonaldTrump is a new low in relations between the US President and the Media. Despite severe pressure and battering from the Govt - the US media is not backing down from its aggressive stance against Trump... this aggressive nature is in sharp contrast to the bovine nature of the Indian media that has made peace with the Govt and does as asked for .... 

In Ep54 of #TheDeshBhakt - we contrast the 'Sanskari' nature of the Indian media to that of the US that borders on rude and over aggressive .... you choose what is better. 

Ofcourse if you choose the US version then you must support us on Patreon or Instamojo - so that we can carry on doing what we do!

Did Kanhaiya really chant the Aazadi slogan, did he really lament the hanging of Afzal guru - NO says the confident former JNUSU President as he takes the big leap into formal politics. 

I sat down with Kanhaiya in Guwahati and asked him YOUR questions (from Patreon and few from YT/Twitter) on Afzal / his politics / Why the Left? / His agenda / His love for Modi and how he sees this country.... 

Unlike other netas - Kumar comes across as crisp / clear / confident and razor sharp - would be interesting to see where he goes! Part 2 follows soon - with the RAPID FIRE ROUND!"

Can Narendra Modi be taken on his word or does his politics make him abandon his spoken AND written word?
We put 18,000 of his tweets, spanning 8 years through sophisticated Data Analytics to understand the real Mann-Ki-Baat of Modi.

This is where Data Analytics - meets journalism - meets political satire. We hope you enjoy our most ambitious attempt at furthering the conversation about our political leadership."

Kissa Kursi Ka | India's finest political satire movie? | Akash Banerjee,tPYcluI0INc,2018-06-30T06:21:38Z,456255,32752,2784,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tPYcluI0INc/default.jpg,1010,#video,"In the midst of the choking Emergency that Indira Gandhi had imposed - was born a movie that was destined to be banned from the word go - but one that would help in he downfall of Sanjay Gandhi.  

Kissa Kursi Ka - despite its shoddy production values - has very limited competition in terms of peers when it comes to Political Satire in Bollywood. Released in the middle of the emergency - it dared to mock the Gandhis and mock the hollowness of netas - no surprise, it faced the wrath of Sanjay Gandhi. 

But the face of politicians it showed then - the ways of their operation and the greed of the netas - all fit in excellently well today - 40 years+ down the line, NOTHING really has changed in the way politicians and politics works in this nation.

#WhySoSerious boldly goes where no news channel has dared to go - and uncover the truth behind Tharoor's language skills !!!!!

#WhySoSerious - is an ambitious attempt to make news less serious / more satirical / more socially conscious and one that speaks for the people and not political parties. To do that effectively - in an in-depth manner - regularly - we need YOUR support to change the narrative and encourage some plain-speak.  

Do support is in one of these two ways - 

1. join our community with a small monthly contribution via Patreon

OR 

2. A one time contribution via Instamojo -

But more than contribution - it would be invaluable if you could stay tuned and spread the good word!!!!"
